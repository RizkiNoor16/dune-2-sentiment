It completely gave up on characters except for giving Timothee Chalamet a little angry brood for the last two thirds. The visual effects were amazing, as one would expect. So many amazing…",en,3

Given that, it's remarkable how much of Villeneuve's vision remains in the massive slab of film that is Dune: Part Two. It's an amazing visual spectacle and maybe that's all that we should expect from an epic like this. Certainly, it's leaps and bounds ahead of the recent Star Wars and Marvel movies. ",en,3

On the other hand, Austin Butler fully commits to his role and felt natural.

I think the source material will never be a returning fave for me but it's a worthwhile world building to explore. More comedy than I expected, themes less subtle but necessarily so.

That being said, it’s a bit on slow side, and I feel like it basks in its own visual spectacle a little too much when it should be advancing the story forward. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great, well acted, visual feast with a meaty story… but it’s a little full of itself in a way the first one was not.",en,4

Although the whole movie is one long trip so perhaps that makes up for it. Also, it’s a solid attempt to highlight the critique of Christian missionaries and to lean less into the pro white messiah elements of the novel, but feels a little underdeveloped there.
