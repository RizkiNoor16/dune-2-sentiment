## Follow up Question
1. How did you vectorize the reviews? /justify your choice of algorithm?
   
   Answer :
   
   The reviews are vectorized using a pre-trained transformer-based model for text classification. This is because the community providing movie reviews on Letterboxd website is highly 
   creative, and it requires a model that can understand the context of these text reviews effectively.
   The BERT model is a powerful transformer-based architecture known for its effectiveness in capturing contextual information in text data. This choice is justified as BERT models have     shown state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.
3. How would you calculate the accuracy of your sentiment predictor?
   
   Answer :
   
   To determine the accuracy of the sentiment predictor, we compare the predicted labels generated by the model with the actual labels from the validation dataset. The accuracy   
   evaluation result is: 0.437073775573465
4. How would you calculate the speed of inference ?
   
   Answer :
   
   The inference speed can be calculated by measuring the time taken by the model to process each input sample. In the demonstration, the observed inference speed is approximately ~0.06     seconds.
5. What would be your next steps to improve the solution ?
   
   Answer :
   - Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on a larger dataset to further improve its performance on sentiment analysis for movie reviews.
   - Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the model.
   - Implementing techniques for handling class imbalance in the dataset.
