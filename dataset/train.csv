3083,Would def watch the Tool music video section of this film again.,2
2456,I wanna ride the worm,2
2006,Maybe I just didn’t get it but I didn’t think it was as good as alot of these reviews :/. ,1
1209,IS THIS YOUR KING? YouTube review coming soon.,1
7255,"I thought the movie was great — everyone did an amazing job, especially zendaya — BUT why is nobody talking about how this movie is so relevant to what is happening in our world TODAY with Palestine and Israel??? Obviously the context is different but it’s still a war for land and power between the minority (the fremen to which are literally cosplaying as Muslim —sorry I said it but it’s so true) and white people (literally they are painted so white it’s fucking blinding) !! This movie couldn’t have come out at a worst time (but still a great movie)",3
4683,For a movie where I had 0 idea wtf was going on it was pre good,2
9361,"The one of the best ""The chosen one"" arc films till date.",4
8572,timothee chalamet's charisma so high they made him a messiah,4
9671,Holy fucking shit.,4
3027,"So what I have gathered from comrade Villeneuve is that if Quebec wants to seperate, they gotta convert to Islam en masse with the help of the worlds funkiest white boy who is a heir to one of Canada's biggest oligarch kingdoms (either Telecom, Groceries or Mining). Say no more! ",2
9288,i would say that feyd rautha is soooo psycHOTic,4
9529,lots of austin butler jumpscares also zendaya my queen i would never do u like that,4
7016,"3.75 stars if we want to get technical. im always going to love a big, sci-fi world. i cant resist a little escapism! The Bene Gesserit rock and i appreciate evil and mysterious women representation. and for that reason i must say...too much fighting not enough proselytize from Lady Jessica!! i dont think showing that would have added to the movie and would have been cut, but i would have liked it 😔",3
7204,Still can’t get over the main character being called Paul,3
5670,thanks denis i now have a fear of religions fabricated by shadow players of the empire,3
6487,"Well, I definitely enjoyed this more than the first part! I think a big contributing factor to this was watching on a big screen. If you're able to, I really do recommend watching this in the cinema.",3
10919,Damn 70mm goes so insanely hard it’s wild. This movie is fucking sooooooooo good. I have seen this 5 times and I’m going back for more on Sunday!!!! I have spent 66 dollars on this movie in 70mm alone!!! Shout out amc pass for all the other times!! I’ve already said all there is to say in the pass 4 reviews lol. This movies kicks so much ass GO SEE THIS IN IMAX PLEASE!!! ,4
2461,not enough terrible purpose imo,2
1348,Had a good sleep with this one,1
489,Most redundant movie.. More talking than an actual plot. Very disappointed and won’t be watching again.,0
7279,I TOLD YALL LEE MCQUEEN WOULD FUK WITH THIS Florence Pugh was literally wearing that Joan of Arc chainmail look,3
3805,Stilgar is played by a white man*worms away*,2
8700,my midterms got me fucked up so bad i had to go to the theaters 😭,4
6798,the only way to see this is to be screamed at by an extremely large IMAX screen where I feel like I'm there and I'm sweating my ass off ,3
10414,rewatched not-on-imax. screenplay and acting and visual effects and editing and cinematography and music were all of a sudden terrible:// sorry guys i was wrong this movie is horse shit,4
3432,I feel like Paul didn’t have to be a dick abt it but I still had a good time,2
3091,haven’t watched the first part so i didn’t know what to expect this movie is is so freaking cool but very loud and a bit confusing,2
4227,"meow meow why the mid rating …. listen this movie had a lot of beautiful scenes, technically it was astounding, the visuals the sound the sets the costumes: couldn’t have done better. however! 😊 might just b a haterrrr but i have some serious beef w the acting and script in this movie 😭 time and time again zendaya is unable to convince me that she’s not zendaya instead of the character she’s playing, istg her and timothee always sound…",2
354,"""Dune Part 2"" is an exercise in cinematic disappointment that borders on insult to both fans of the franchise and to the art of storytelling itself. Following in the footsteps of its lackluster predecessor, this sequel doubles down on the sins of its predecessor while managing to introduce new ones of its own.",0
5460,OH so it’s an allegory,3
2916,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,2
6272,"much better than the first.  it was predictable even tho I haven't read the books or seen spoilers, BUT it still had me on the edge of my seat throughout bc the tension was PALPABLE.  ",3
1561,Fell asleep again need to rewatch,1
4180,"didn’t finish the first part, so kinda confused. Very good cinimatography tho. very orange.",2
1620,Too much sand,1
6509,Women with weird ass face coverings hall of fame.,3
9474,"Actually huge. The first movie ends relying on the second one to deliver on something great, and it actually did. Stuck the landing is an understatement.",4
2099,Yk what? I’m gonna stop pretending I like these sci fi epics. Just not for me,1
4193,timmy was doing TOO much with all that whimpering and shit😹😹😹😹😹,2
9009,Watching Dune Part 2 on a 270° screen is the greatest cinema experience of my life ,4
2263,Javier bardem soooo funny in this,1
6108,"In another life, Javier Bardem is the Jesus man on Yonge and Dundas",3
9563,yep. austin butler is still hot.,4
2633,Was looking forward to the sequel of the very good part 1 (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️) but invariably let down with bloated 2nd & 3rd acts. CGI Gladiator scenes with mean & nasty Elvis/Feyd were poor and I did get rather tired of Tim & Shandaya looking longingly over sand dunes in the sunset. Not convinced Tim’s a suitable Paul I do feel inclined to kick sand in his face. Perhaps Austin could have been the better leading man. Can’t say I’m looking forward to # 3 in what looks more and more a franchise.,2
3771,the 70 mm film rolling in the back made it so much more cooler,2
2079,utter garbage. You have all the talent and money in the world and you still fumble dune adaptations. Why does every director stray needlessly from the book for no reason???,1
3302,spectacular but the script was dire,2
10573,Science fiction at its peak. Can't wait to see what Denis does next,4
5688,"Better than the one, the battle in the middle of the movie , gladiator style in black and white is amazing",3
3616,all that amazing casts with just 5 seconds screen time???,2
5404,"Once again, the spectacle is everything: awe-inspiring vistas and staggering design pairing with stirring music and cinematography. But here, Villeneuve at last dabbles in storytelling - cleverly making exterior the internal conflicts of the novel. But beneath the film's grandeur and large-stroke genius, there is too-little attention to detail, exemplified by the four different ways ""Feyd-Rautha"" is pronounced the first four times we hear it.",3
10094,"Groups of people were repeatedly saying “LISAN AL-GAIB” as I exited the theater. The ramifications of DUNE films may be greater than anyone ever could have imagined. Villeneuve is converting the world to Islam, one AMC at a time.",4
8404,so good tfrick,4
3716,my fav character was elvis😍😍,2
2131,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,1
7175,bald austin butler😩,3
9032,"""Dune: Part 2"" surpasses all expectations, delivering a cinematic experience of epic proportions. Denis Villeneuve masterfully continues his adaptation of Frank Herbert's sprawling sci-fi saga with this stunning sequel. From breathtaking visuals to mesmerizing performances, every aspect of the film is meticulously crafted.",4
3134,I wonder why Greg feels the need to underexpose almost every shot in almost every thing he does.,2
7469,"Watch it while you’re dehydrated to experience this movie fully… also Austin butler was easily the best part of the movie, so psychotic and menacing",3
4439,"y'all just rate it high to seem cool and intelligent, ain't no way you actually liked it#stopmakingmovies",2
4395,I don’t think I realized how many dunes there are gonna be? Felt rushed but also a bit long. I need to be convinced…,2
3516,Apologies to the folk next to me & ethan gamez 4 laughing at scenes that weren’t exactly supposed to be funny ,2
2179,Someone please tell Tim-tim that screaming isn't a cheat code for good acting,1
401,this may be the most overhyped franchise…i feel like i’m not watching the same movie as everyone else because it was just horrible. This movie somehow made nonstop action boring.,0
0,"* TLDR: austin butler most definitely has the sauce, villeneuve most definitely does not - actually he hasn’t had it since maelstrom (his best movie! not a joke like im so serious)",0
2080,This was the sandiest movie ever made,1
5659,"He rode the worm, then she rode his worm",3
6354,Saw this with Aubrey and wow. Wow wow wow. I understand why this franchise has such a cult following. The cinematography was insanely gorgeous along with all the jaw-dropping plot points. Timothy has gone up a few notches in my book. The fight scenes and the tension had me constantly gripping my chair in suspense. I can’t separate this from part one which I really love as this is supposed to be a continuation. This movie left me wanting more in the best way. (I want a desert mouse pet now).,3
6133,I don't know what was a better fight. The final fight scene or the fight that happened in the theatre ,3
3969,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,2
6969,The spice of life !,3
1242,"really, everyone?",1
23,"It’s not often that I give a one star review but Dune 2 deserves it. Really long and pretty good movie, some scenes were super boring.",0
5601,He had the option But he chose the other way #justiceforchani,3
8633,Simply the best movie i’ve ever seen in the theater.,4
8993,I needed 3 more hours of this.,4
2766,"Pacing was off on this film. Felt much longer than it is and with a film that’s already over 2 hours 30 that’s an issues, feel like there was a few scenes that could of been trimmed down.",2
10,Other than the cast and the visuals of the sand and black and white arena scene why are people thinking this is the best movie of the year?,0
2709,"Yeah action movies hella goofy i just cant get into the story with silly lines like that cmon now Also why do they overdramatize and oversimplify everything (nearly no character development), the horn was so obnoxious and LOUD, shots were rushed and why did Austin Butler's character have the Elvis voice still.... ",2
3666,"Maybe is bc I don’t remember the first part, but this movie was awfully long & I didn’t understand much of it.Feyd-Rautha 😩😩",2
3821,beautiful gowns,2
1506,No thank you.,1
4421,I don’t want to see instagram face being portrayed as a phrophet for the freman and it,2
8461,"Such an incredible film. I liked how it is well shot and has great lighting without making it overtly good-looking, keeping the rugged look of the film.",4
7293,"Really good continuation of the first film, with much more character exploration and depth. The returning cast excelled, specifically Javier Bardem's Stilgar, who brought some much needed humour in a film that could otherwise have been a dirge. I wasn't too keen on some of the newer facers - Austin Butler's character was weak in my opinion, and Christopher Walken just played the same character we've seen him play numerous times in the past. ",3
6561,"Full scale worldbuilding. To be five hours invested into a story arc is a luxury you don’t often get in the cinema, so it felt big - and not just “CGI big budget IMAX” big.",3
6539,happened to be in the same screening as an old friend! lisan-al-gaib brought us back together 🤯🤩,3
519,"Dune Part One was absolutely monumental for me. Safe to say the best film I have ever seen on a big screen, cause it was simply made for cinema, and also one of my favourite films of all time. What Denis Villeneuve did with Dune was so bold and daring, seeking new heights he singlehanded redefined what modern high-budget productions could be like. Dune delivered a perfectly coherent piece of art, with quality being a consistency in all areas that…",0
183,sensual but ultimately very straight,0
3255,Emotionally hollow BR2049. What's the point of making the most beautiful spectacle you've ever seen in the cinema if there's absolutely no backbone or end purpose to it? Apart from politics which sniffs ass,2
5629,The best casting I've ever seen in a big blockbuster movie. Bonus points for Christopher Walken playing the role of Emperor Christoper Walken. ,3
1579,„Kann man machen.“Spent the Night researching the Bene Gesserit. Conclusion: want to be one.Alternative: fuse with a sand worm. One of the two,1
3165,"so fucking long it felt like torture to sit through this whole thing. long movies don’t usually bother me that much but good lord i was begging for it to end, the movie wasn’t bad either way i just don’t understand the hype",2
1974,"really wanted to like this one so bad, but maybe the overhype killed it for me",1
10763,Watching it alone in IMAX is like stumbling across the desert  and finding an oasis that is oh so beautiful,4
1897,Best part was when the credits started rolling,1
943,Plenty of room for improvement when it comes Dune Two it,1
2038,not my cup of teafell asleepif waylan brothers was in it u man would give it 5,1
2219,Absolutely fucking not,1
11181,breathtaking! i already want to watch it again,4
10520,This literally felt like reading the world’s most epic sci fi novel!! Which is probably telling of how good of an adaptation it is and now I really want to read the book. ,4
8365,I watched this movie with my friend and lets just say we were screaming in the cinema,4
2762,My friend fell asleep during the Austin Butler intermission and missed literally nothing important....,2
4472,Austin Butler went from doing an Elvis impression to doing a Stellan Skarsgård impression. Will he be stuck sounding Swedish forever now?,2
6639,"I love when characters say the title of the movie, in the movie.",3
2026,"Maybe it’s because I went to the bathroom, but where was the catalyst for the sudden 180 where Paul decides he is going to be the messiah? Besides drinking the worm juice? I think Denis Villeneuve focused too much on spectacle yet again, and forgot about the characters in the process. All I see is A-Listers in dress-up.",1
3581,"a film with a uninspiring, poorly paced 1h50m drastically saved by its final hour or so. ",2
4059,How can I possibly take Austin seriously as a villain when I still remember him as the hot cousin from Aliens in the Attic? ,2
1305,畫面音樂是好的～難得有科幻片拍到好似star wars咁feel可惜嘅係我覺得timothee zendaya都演得不太好有少少嘥咗:(( any肥Florence bb真係好靚女🥹😭愛死了 然後Austin butler真心型撚到癲 勁有氣勢 同埋我真係勁鍾意oscar同rebecca…又係超型,1
7946,"Completely deserves the hype - the cinematic experience alone is worth a watch, whether a reader of the books or not. Any slight pacing issues in the first half are made negligible by the tension of the second, where Timothee demonstrates without a doubt his aptitude for the role. Zimmer’s score and the overall sound design are integral to making the story immersive and the emotional beats resonant - every line is felt deeply.",3
9965,"Best experience I have had in a theater, and prob top 5 overall. So engaging in so many ways. I’m so glad I didn’t read the book before but definitely will now.",4
8308,"A little weak, still great",3
4489,"i came for the Shai-Hulud popcorn bucket, but stayed for the BDSM Russians in 70mm IMAX. Kinkiest dune yet, can’t wait for the next",2
11119,seeing this in imax 70mm was quite literally a religious experience,4
6816,team Chani,3
307,"Maybe I will circle back for a longer tilt at justification, but this is the kind of corny occult-genetics-megapower cinema I hope we can leave behind.",0
7509,timothee really ate,3
5214,gonna start saying “as written” whenever i see someone do something interesting,2
632,"Time passes easily and things happened before my eyes. Much like the book, it has no lasting impact on me and I don’t care for the world or the characters. All very hollow. This feels worse than most other prominent sci fi/fantasy films or books I can think of. Scale us non existent so nothing has much impact. Put all my eggs into the worm basket and even they let me down. Love the idea of a grandfather worm though. …",1

4063,Austin and Timmy shouldve kissed,2
5963,"RIP to the Lumière Brothers, you would’ve loved Dune",3
11246,"Seeing this in IMAX is the greatest cinema experience of my life. I thought the first Dune film was great, but this one blows it out of the water. Not only is this potentially the greatest sci-fi film I've ever seen, but it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen full stop. The sheer scale, magnitude and ambition of this film is truly breathtaking, and it's executed with such finesse and technical mastery that it's practically hard for me…",4

3744,"Key Points:- Visually stunning with an amazing soundtrack that compliments the world building. The world that’s been created and displayed on screen is incredible. - Very fast paced, with a lot crammed in. Overall I think this is a negative. Repeatedly scenes felt rushed, where a little more detail or time to expand the scene would create greater understanding on what’s happening and emotional investment. - Definitely a film worthy of watching in the cinema ",2
11225,"This movie’s got everything:A love story  ✅Gorgeous cinematography ✅A struggle of morals, love, and power ✅Christopher Walken ✅A Bald ass Austin Butler ✅Timothee Chalamet once again settling for Florence Pugh instead of his true love ✅",4
917,This movie is a whole bunch of nothing. It’s like a blend of midsommar and twilight. I will say it does a good of making you feel what the want you to feel. Extremely sensory!,1
5628,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,3
1295,"Finally, some consistent action and plot progression that the first movie was sorely lacking. This definitely moved much faster than part one, sometimes to the point where it felt rushed. Despite this, I think part 2 still suffered from some of the same problems as part 1. The way plot points were presented felt sloppy at times, and weren't elaborated on nearly enough. I also don't understand why the changes from the book were made, as I feel they detract…",1
1763,When he said «dune» that hit hard man,1
4128,Would have loved to see what was happening in the lovely defined empire rather than the boring desert,2
3559,I liked this one better than the first one (Florence and Austin being in it might have been a contributing factor) lowkey it was rly confusing but I still enjoyed it. (Also wayyy too long),2
7079,"Visually beautiful, interesting to make the Harkhonnen goth weirdos. Big worms good. Javier Bardem stealing scenes. Rebecca Ferguson is always amazing. My friend pointed out the time line feels weird and it seems like it needed some more scenes to have that make sense. And Walken at the end is great, but he's just so Walken even trying reel it in it took me out of it.",3
2878,"As a stand alone film, the first dune is more complete. As a sequel I can appreciate what this bridges too but honestly not even close to the empire strikes back",2

I liked when Austin butler licked the knife he was probably the best in this? I liked Florence Pugh and Zendaya. Timothee did my head in by the end honestly. The last hour or so I couldn’t be bothered!! Too…,2

Takes the fanciful shine away from it. ,3
9132,"It’s finally here: Denis Villeneuve’s long-awaited second part of his epic film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel. “Dune: Part Two” offers an engaging, lucid and spectacular continuation of the story and tells interesting things about myths, colonialism, ecology, religion and fate.

10300,This is the most awestruck I’ve been by a movie in a long time. Entertaining from start to finish because of how good the pacing of this story is & this movie had some of my favorite performances from so many of the cast members. I’ll be saying Lisan al-Gaib in my sleep tonight.,4
8212,Nice Life of Brian reference,3
5724,"hard to form a definitive opinion of this (and Dune Part 1 as well) without seeing how the entire trilogy plays out, but i think it’s safe to say villeneuve knows what he’s doing and is cooking with gas. no doubt in my mind that Dune will be this generation’s great fantasy/sci-fi trilogy, akin to lotr and star wars",3
9545,"Denis Villenueve constantly reminds me why I love movies so much, and that’s why he’s my favourite director! Dune Part 2 was an audio-visual experience that absolutely arrested me from start to finish! It is grand, thrilling, beautifully shot and wonderfully performed by the entire cast. The world of Arrakis is one of the most fleshed out, immersive and beautiful worlds I’ve ever seen on film (rivalling what Denis did in Blade Runner 2049). It has such an amazing sense of scale, and it truly feels like a real place. ",4

3864,"I justly had insanely high expectations going into this due to the insane levels of praise I've seen for the film. However, part of me felt that I would be let down, and that part of me was right. It's good and has quite a few stand out moments, but throughout the end of the first act and majority of the second act, I found it hard to stay fully interested and engaged in what was going on until the plot picked up pace again in the third act. Really wished I loved it as much as everyone else, but it is what it is.",2
6376,"Remarkable cinematic experience. One of the only times I've ever felt such a significant degree of epicness in a cinema - Oppenheimer probably only other time in recent memory, or my over decade-old distinct recollection of watching Skyfall on its release day, which was such a special experience that it's stuck with me ever since.

4559,Big improvement: however zendaya having magical tears is awful writing and the non action dragged too long yet again,2
26,"“Spice changed my life” I feel like I watched a completely different movie to everyone else. Denis Villeneuve has always been great at directing and expressing these dystopian worlds visually, giving each setting its own personality.

7690,Javier Bardem is the standout for me even on my rewatch. Also the title drop still goes hard.,3
8418,I honestly don't think I've seen a more beautiful film in this cinema before. Someone like myself who is a huge fan of the book. I genuinely think what Denis has done is nothing more than a miracle. It really shows how truly talented this man is. The cinematography and score as well really helps. This movie also proves that studios need to take a step back and let people really talented people do their job.,4

1958,"I really disliked how war-heavy it is.I guess I've always envisioned it to be so intricate with overflowing world building, but I've come to find it is really plain. Everything that exists in this fantastical universe exists only to wage war. Every character is there to serve Paul. There was never a true sense of high stakes since the special powers and weapons were too op. I'm hoping the books will fill me in on the deeper lore, as there is so much promise there.",1

One of my favourite things was the beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. SOOOO MOVING AND SO POWERFUL. I’ve seen this movie twice already im gonna have to go see it another 10 times.

3425,"i feel like i watched a completely different movie than everybody else. apart from the great casting (idk about timothée tho) and marvellous cinematography, it didn’t really impact me. it had the same problems as the first one, it created anticipation of something that wasn’t delivered. the dialogues sometimes sounded as if they were written by a high schooler, but makes sense since Villeneuve doesn’t care about them. i’ll rewatch it, maybe i’ll see it differently.",2

How is she not killed on sight whenever she gets uppity in any of the scenes she’s in? Always was thinking about how much I’d prefer to watch Star Wars.

3336,"Villeneuve's Dune(s) is very similar to sand in nature. It is voluminous and dense, but slowly loses its magnitude through the fingers in the attempt to be gripped and observed.The brutalism of Arrakis and the various structures it houses is a marvel to be seen, but the façade of grandeur wears off because the characters begin to feel as square as the structures.I shall not go as far as to call the metaphors 'on the nose', but it…",2

8607,unfortunately... so good 🧎‍♀️,4
3787,I don’t hide it that I was very underwhelmed by Dune the first. As a big Denis Villeneuve fan and a casual respecter of the concept of the book I don’t know if I was excited for these movies but I was looking forward to it. And then what we got was not really too encouraging. Dreadfully didactic and shallow visuals really made the first movie drag. For a time I was unable to distinguish this from a Christopher Nolan…,2
4625,"I dare say, too little Sandworm content.",2
5493,"This is the half of the book I remember struggling with. There's lots of dream sequences, and talking about prophecies, and everything slows to a crawl. Villeneuve does a decent job of injecting some pace to it all, upping the action and adding a sense of urgency to proceedings. Crucially it's weirder than the first, which I relished, but at the end of the day it's still half a book and an open-ended one at that. Fingers crossed Warners will let Villeneuve make Dune Messiah and finish Paul's story. If he pulls it off this could be the best genre trilogy since Lord of the Rings.",3
3815,"I was really excited about this until the last third.Love only rooting for a character that mostly just stares in the camera dramatically, at times slightly angrily in an ultimate act of resistanceNow that I think about it that's not just Chani it's every feminine characterSomeone desperately needs to permanently project Anya Taylor-Joy's ""feminine rage"" monologue in the Hollywood skies",2

I still see echoes of Jodorowsky's Dune. The action is great, though. Stilgar was fun and House Harkonnen is as despicable as it should be. Only the emperor was a bit bland, I thought.

3650,"Full IMAX experience. Had moments of greatness but as with all Dune media, it’s just too much sand for my liking. When we visit the Harkonnen it’s literally a godsend. It’s also 25 minutes too long.",2
5664,The water of life is baby worm inside liquids 😔,3
1955,Who up playing with they worm or…I really went off on the last one and I feel even worse about this one. Got off of reading the books and in comparison this just feels so unimaginative and grey when Herbert created such a rich world already. I don’t mind on principle that they change things for the movie but I think that the changes that they instituted make the movie less interesting. I continue to think that this movie…,1
8248,"So many thoughts I believed would translate to bullet point form in the week since I've seen this again but I guess I can just say: an entry in the history of Blockbuster cinema that will redirect the trajectory of mainstream cinema the same way TDK did in 2008, and a movie that is far smarter than it is given credit for. ",3
3370,"Spectacular and really gripping in places, more so than Dune (Part One?), but I can't shake the feeling that I enjoyed it less.",2
7651,"Great visuals, sound and effects, and the story was ok but I didn’t love the ending. Yet I’d watch more in this universe.",3

9823,"I get the feeling that, no matter what I did, the expectations I set for this movie would be higher than possibly achievable. Did I like the first one more because of that? I think so. Do I feel — by any measure — disappointed? No. There is just something about these movies that get my heart racing like the way movies used to when I was a kid. That doesn’t happen enough anymore. The first one absolutely recked me and my understanding of the limitations of cinema, and by all means this one did not do that. But, man, did it get my heart racing.",4
5018,"While visually stunning, this movie ultimately makes some indefensible deviations from the source material that end up weakening the film. Chani is laughably bad change and the script leaves something to be desired. Ends up becoming a slightly disappointing adaptation. Perhaps that’s my fault for going into the theater expecting a more faithful adaptation.",2

Separately, they do still feel like brilliantly made pieces of a more masterful combination. That said, I can’t wait for Dune: Messiah.

2725,I didn’t enjoy Dune. I felt alienated by many aspects of it and I was not looking forward to repeating the experience. Unfortunately where characters spoke in an alien accent there wsd  b no English translation. Oddly though I found it easier to follow and I did enjoy the sensations of seeing it on an IMAX screen with astonishingly responsive to sound seating m. Everything is excruciatingly earnest but a much more satisfying watch.,2

It isnt enough to justify Denis' stultifying direction of the film's dialogue scenes (of which the film is mostly comprised) nor the actual content of his dialogue, which looks purely to further the plot to its end point in totally simplistic terms. Stilgar is beautifully realised by Javier Bardem yet the often comedic sense of his belief in Paul betrays the distance Denis has placed between us and the themes…",2

1009,i went to see this movie because i saw timothee chalamet in “wonka” and loved it. i LOVE wonka. and i love seeing all the different fun kinds of chocolates and candies! so naturally i thought i would like this. but it was absolutely nothing like wonka. made me feel really bad actually. no jokes… nobody sang a single song. i got excited when he started to walk funny in the sand thinking he was gonna dance. but the music never kicked in. to say i feel lied to is an understatement. i’m not sure what they were thinking here. really pissed off about this one.,1

4092,"I read Dune during 2020 lockdown, and I loved it and was so thrilled about Dune part one, but honestly was a bit of a letdown and flop for me since I felt nothing really happened (other than Leto dying😭.) Part two is great, no question, I was only bored once or twice and more happened for sure…",2
7461,"Absolutely beautiful, but too much time spent on the battle field and too little on Paul’s acid trips on the sacred water. Although the whole movie is one long trip so perhaps that makes up for it. Also, it’s a solid attempt to highlight the critique of Christian missionaries and to lean less into the pro white messiah elements of the novel, but feels a little underdeveloped there. Since I hear there won’t be a directors (?) cut I’ll pin my hopes on these issues being resolved in a sequel. All that aside, when combined with part one it’s easily one of the best sci-fi films ever made.",3

3399,"Awesome costumes, lots of epic set pieces and incredible action, but the narrative pacing feels off, which is most salient in the fact that you never really get that the big satisfying payoff that is constantly being alluded to, but which never arrives... Also, I think someone told Zimmerman to tone down that ethnic screaming lady that is constantly trying to tell the audience that something important is happening so at least that was at least a plus!

It seems as though the entire planet has boarded a spacecraft bound for Arrakis, leaving me marooned on an island of  discontent. While the masses revel in what they perceive as a masterstroke of science fiction, I'm slogging through what feels like an interminable, albeit aesthetically pleasing, quagmire.",2

Now, I like white boy Jihad, orientalism, and space feudalism as much as anyone else, but this movie felt kind of sloppy, some silly and stupid dialogue especially from the two main characters. Tim Charlemenage's emaciated ass did not pass as a product of centuries of space eugenics, nor did I enjoy how during the last third of the movie villeneuve made me look at zenyada making dumb frowny face every damn scene.…",2
120,"The story is full of patriarchy, religion, superstition, unnecessary wars and violence. Nice, right? Okay, no robots, no computers, fine. But why do the poor people from the desert speak an Arabic-like language? Why taking their culture? Zero phantasy.

7174,"Its a really good sequel. I liked the world building the most. There's one scene where a sand dune collapses in on itself in a certain way and its just too good lol. It developed the characters more and some of the lore was explored as well, Im more inspired to read the books now. Austin Butlers character was really entertaining.

10246,"""Dune: Part 2"" continues the epic saga with a riveting exploration of theocratic autocracy and the insidious spread of religious fanaticism. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully portrays the power dynamics at play, as a cabal of selective breeding space witches who I would not object to getting know a lil better cuz they some freaks, known as the Bene Gesserit, manipulates political and religious forces to maintain control over the desert planet Arrakis.

That said it is an exercise in bein utterly bludgeoned by plot, and when the story firehose isn’t on, then it’s 80 out of 140 minutes of desert warfare which isn’t that interesting in it’s design and composition, let alone when it’s presented ad nauseam.

2657,This is literally amazing as a sci-fi franchise movie but it simultaneously loses me as a film beyond everything that’s currently making it a spectacle. So many factors of this movie are executed on such a heightened level but end up feeling more like cogs in a larger narrative machine rather than characters and stories I should presently care about.

591,the Dolby atmos screen in my AMC was an excellent place to watch this I thought the worms were coming into the theater and it was scary,1
4791,"Way too long. Too many sudden character reversals, and our big bad (or what I thought was going to be the big bad) suddenly vanquished. It gets 3 stars because the music, grand effects and because it was beautifully filmed.  Star Wars but with drugs and worms. My kids loved it though.",2
3344,I wish I could give it more stars but when I watched it it was pretty late and I kept falling asleep so I probably haven't seen the same movie as everyone but I know for sure that the battles were awesome,2

I’ll take it.  Aesthetically, the movie is still bland, spank bank for this years burning man attire and strives to be what every techie dreams live/work spaces looked like.

After a second watch I can say that it doesn’t quite beat Prisoners for me but man it’s close. Pure entertainment from start to finish I tell ya! Movies are back bros…",4
2745,"I think because this film (series) has been so incredibly publicised and showcased as strictly ZENDAYA AND TIMOTHEE CHALAMET it’s really hard for me to get into the characters and their relationship.

Overlong but spiced with druggy and fervid imagery, there’s lots to recommend it, including a talking fetus. Thankfully a sense of humor is evident. The stucture has lots of clever scene transitions (Harkonnen world -> Paul’s nightmare.) The worm riding is especially thrilling, much better than pod racing. The sand and the machines feel real but the drawn out prophecy hokum, the main thrust of…",2
5933,"The second time was not as good ngl… but that’s probably because I went into a he movie trying to find things I didn’t like about it and I think I payed to much attention to the details I did not like, as  opposed to just experiencing the movie like I did the first time I watched it",3
1668,"Once again, the Dune movie has left me disappointed. Im all for world building and character set up but for it to be almost three hours and to have nothing to amount for? I left the theater feeling so unsatisfied and debating if my friends who hype these movies up are watching the same movie i am. For the MC to stand for something the entire movie and then to drink the water of life and just skirt and start doing exactly what he said he wasnt going to was so annoying and frustrating.",1

776,"The amount of hype this got definitely contributed to how much I hated it. I walked in expecting an utter masterpiece, but it was paced strangely, somehow too slow—the cinematography was stunning, but narratively ineffective, it’s hard to care about any of these characters, etc etc… wouldn’t have been such a letdown if people weren’t saying this is the greatest piece of cinema ever made.",1

Denis Villeneuve once again did an exceptional job on this project and deserves all the praise as well as the entire team that acomplished this achievement. Cinematography was beyond beautiful and definitely an upgrade from previous movie. I liked soundtrack more in this one,…",3

6668,"To analyze Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune comes down to analyzing the style - it doesn't really have anything additional to offer - but truth be said it is at least done quite impressively.Villeneuve stays faithful to his own style and unfortunately has to sacrifice the more ethereal/spiritual mood of how Arrakis is presented in the book, obviously going for the look that is very grungy and essentially Earthy.

Paul’s struggle with prescience and the effects of spice melange, the spacing guild, the other-worldly mysticism of the Fremen - all these things that add to the depth of the story seemed to be put on the chopping block or barely brought to life in favour of a mild version of the story that will be palatable for popcorn audiences. Geidi Prime was perfect however, and it’s a real shame that energy couldn’t be maintained for the rest of the film.",2

5077,"I can see why people like these so much, Villeneuve has essentially achieved here what Peter Jackson did with the LOTR trilogy, by taking slightly dense and inaccessible genre fiction from the 60’s and unleashing all the mythic grandeur and scale suggested by the text while simultaneously imbuing the world of the novel with a weighty, tactile verisimilitude. At its best I was practically rubbing bits of spice and sand out of my eyes!! It’s a treasure trove of beautifully…",2

9520,"So, what can I even say that someone didn’t say before about it?I was absolutely stunned from every frame the film has and I’m not fooling around, the first minutes showed how fascinating is the world that Villeneuve gives us with perfect angles and great palette of colors. I was so amazed from the beauty of the composition that without a doubt I can say this film is the perfect answer to the question of what’s cinema.The film is a thousand times better if you watched in imax cause some frames are the way the director meant to portray it.",4

The book and story is really about fate and mysticism and power; this movie tried to undermine the very things that make the story cool. ,2

Once again Villeneuve knows how to direct visually, but loses everything but the basics of the plot in truly adapting these books. Dune is not something you can fully adapt. People will watch this movie and assume it adapts the book, but it doesn't really unfortunately.",2
445,Performances of Chalamet and Zendaya are so so painful. Two of the most unnaturalistic actors I've seen. For Chalamet in particular every movement or inflection in his voice is all so plainly rehearsed and forced through.

39,"You know, it's really unfortunate when directors, when making a movie for Hollywood and American audiences, more often than not try to mimic the slow and atmospheric tone and pacing of usual art house fare and fail to understand that a lot of the time in those moments of calm and quiet, there is something to actually think about, talk about, look at. Slop. Dreck. Yawn.",0
9985,"Truly a magical experience where I feel like I was transported and could see how much of a construct time really is. Plus, I'm left with questions about fear, faith and power. What more could I want from a film?",4
3445,"I really enjoyed the first hour when Timothee learns how to desert, but it’s downhill once they meet up with Josh Brolin and swing by the atomic bomb shed 😂",2

9569,we’re here to have fun,4
1602,Visually it was very beautiful but dialogs were so shallow and cringe. I had high expectations after the first movie but they turn it into a Hollywood cliche. Most likely to attract more audience.,1
4604,"Dune 2 (2024) is spectacular for its fights, background, colours and settings - the cinematography is excellent. The story just doesn’t win me over - it’s Lord of the Rings, it’s Star Wars. Just not interesting. Denis Villeneuve directs, Timothee Chamalet leads an impressive cast in a futuristic, trippy time. Give me real people in real situations plus Coen Bros comedy, Scorsese’s villains or Tarantino’s bloodshed every time.",2
9770,"My favorite part is when little mouse said ""I had to dune it to them""",4
8344,"Beautiful film, an incredible cast who are all on song. Highly entertaining, it doesnt stop. The world they built is incredibly specific, highlighted with the costuming and the visit to the harkonnen home planet. Loved it.",4
11088,"Probably one of the best films of the 2020s. The sequel was incredible, gripping and amazing. The underlying themes are highly relevant to what is going on today and place a mirror in front of humanity at the fringe. ZENDAYA ATE",4

5480,"Watching it on IMAX just makes it better, audiovisual is insane. Photography, videography, cinematography, you name it. I also like the character design and the planets. But i dont f*ck with the plot though, still asked so many questions while watching it even though i ve wacthed part 1",3
3973,"Successful and professional round up of Dune (2022). Everything about it is essentially unimpeachable, just a stellar production and a well-handled narrative. Denis even makes the sandworm surfing seem reasonable and he makes the Alia plotline work out well. Javier Bardem offers some of the only levity in the picture, Lea Seydoux sparkles in the 2 minutes she has, Austin Butler does a great job, and Timothy Chalamet embodies a confident and angry Paul after drinking the Water of Life.…",2
3660,🔥 TakeWay better than Part 1. Still a bit too long but nice to look atMay my review chip and shatter.,2

5699,I LIKED IT I CANT BELIEVE ADAM SANDLER PLAYED THE GRANDFATHER WORM,3
9090,"Alright that was the one. I’m locked in. Fucking rips. Any issues I had before seem insignificant now. One of the best blockbusters I’ve ever seen and has set a whole new bar for future sci-fi endeavors. It’s just….man we’re lucky to live in this period of cinema, as much as we want to decry the state of the industry (rightfully so, mind you). Middlebrow schmiddlebrow, as long as filmmakers like Villeneuve and Nolan are working, we’re in good hands.",4
2454,Does watching Dune Part 1 make this film’s dialogue less cringey?,2
3958,"One sees why the book was considered unadaptable during large expanses of the movie when it gets mired in world-building and trying to show maturation via passage of time. The fight and battle scenes are stilted and end abruptly, the effects don’t stand out as much in a sci-fi backdrop. The first movie had more memorable characters and scenery; with this, I grew tired of the sand.",2
3185,Austin Butler was just making me giggle idk,2
5305,I liked the princess lady chainmail drip that was fye,2
5444,"A grand spectacle. Visually impeccable and the story was interesting if not a little confusing in parts. Timothee Chalamet really won me over with this film, an incredible performance from him. In fact everybody's performances were brilliant.",3
9081,"Really interesting that frank Herbert described Harkonnen architecture as brutalist, like hell is a giant concrete block, but Denis makes Arakeen brutalist and Harkonnen styles reminiscent of HR Giger. I’m sure there’s an essay in there about changing popular tastes and modern audiences’ willingness to accept brutalism as a basic form of architectural design, rather than the rejection of artistic aesthetics that Herbert originally intended. I’m certainly not the guy to write it tho",4
9075,It’s not enough that I watch this film. I need it inside of me. I need it to penetrate me the way Timothee penetrated that Peach. Peak cinema,4

7541,"Had a wonderful time seeing part 2 at the Morgan hill theater with the ole pops. Definitely better than part 1 and the worm scene was insane!!! However, dad and I shared the same opinion that the plot lost momentum around an hour in. I think I’m just spoiled from watching Game of Thrones too many times bc Dune’s plot and character development is weak. Yeah I said it!!! I just miss the way GOT made me feel. I wanna…",3
4532,Elvis Presley playing a bald sociopath in this movie is crazy,2
7905,I'm sure my opinion will increase over time but as a first viewing this really felt like the middle of a trilogy. Still love the vision and upfront religious overtones but could tell he added action and vehicles to win over filthy casuals. And man I absolutely capitol 'H' HATED the b&w colloseum stuff but Stilgar as hype man and talking fetus won me back. Villeneuve is my kwisatz haderach.,3
5491,reallllyy good acting,3
3271,"Dune 2. Dune 2 much plot exposition IMO! Like the film before it, the story felt slight. I liked part 1 far more. None of the antagonists felt...antagonistic. I'm supposed to be scared of a dude who spends almost the entire film in an oily jacuzzi and who makes threats? And don't get me started on Fayd. THAT'S the performance everyone is going nuts over? Felt mid.",2

Part 2, I thought might be what I wanted but I didn’t connect with any character and thought part 2 was boring too. People love Dune and its story but I am out, I gave it 6 hours and I’m not sold on it",1

10044,Hey guys. It’s a good flick.,4
3020,Beautiful cinematography. Produced as an epic but in doing so they lengthened the movie too unnecessarily. Not enough of a compelling story or action to keep me interested for that long. But the dynamics of the protagonist character was enough to make it worthwhile.,2

4525,"Lisan Al Gaib!!! This film was very pompous. It had a lot of great looking scenes. They were really stunning but some other scenes were given too much pomp that it neared on comedy. Actually every scene with the Lisan Al Gaib - guy was pure comedy.A big plus to Austin Butler. My boy wanted to feel pain and have a good fight. He got what he wanted, that sick little fucker.

5065,Decent movie but it’s still really hard for me to take Timothee serious as a war leader. I would almost prefer lesser known actors to have the main role so their real life and past roles are less of a distraction.,2

8108,"My expectations were low for this film after being disappointed with the first instalment, but this movie did all the things I wanted the first one to do. The effects, especially the worms, were excellent. The acting, outside of a mediocre performance from Chalamet, were terrific. Bardem in particular was as incredible and his character had me laughing in places and fully engaged every time he was on screen. Spending over an hour on the dessert and surviving there have it the time and space it needed. Very well done.",3
7924,"Saw this in an IMAX theater last Monday. Visually spectacular and cinematically stunning, I had to take a bit to sit with it before coming to an opinion on it. And after a week I have to say that while it was mostly fantastic, there are major issues I have with it.",3

Obvi cinematography and sound are amazing, as well as the exploration on the dangers of charismatic leaders and hero/messiah figures.

3011,Didn't dig Zen and Timmy's chemistry. They really bogged down the movie imo. Pacing wasn't the best but it pretty much captured how I felt reading this part of the book. Some scenes were just so cool to watch and the score was amazing. But I left feeling kinda disappointed with Chalamets performance. Gonna need a hard recast if we see the preacher later on.,2
2896,"I enjoyed it but probably due to everything but the writing. Obviously the cinematography and amazing sound design continued on from the first film and I don’t want to make light of that.

I loved seeing chalamets character switch mid way through the movie as he gained more confidence and took the role of the leader. Loved bardems character. He was the ultimate hype man. And of course Austin butlers crazy psycho behavior was an amazing addition that made the villain role so interesting to watch. LOVED the movie!!,3

Austin Butler in particular gives a high-camp, riveting performance. Very different from what we've seen before from him, truly one to watch, he has a great career ahead of him. A great villain…",4

For a 2hr 46m runtime this movie felt rushed, and there were too many new characters introduced that in my opinion could’ve been introduced in the first movie.

The acting too is a mixed bag: Brolin, Ferguson, and Chalamet carry a lot, while Butler and Bardem approach the material in gratingly hammy ways. And huge wastes of Walken, Pugh, and Seydoux. ",1

1577,"Dull dull dull dull. Denis Villeneuve's greatest asset is that he might be the hardest-working director regularly employed in Hollywood today: his greatest shortcoming is that you're never not aware of that fact. Yes, as everyone has said, in an age of televisually-styled blockbusters, this is a tentpole constructed in painstaking fashion on the grandest scale money can buy - but I think it's worth questioning just what all that effort is in service of, and whether that scale is…",1

4116,"It looks spectacular and there are some amazing sequences like from the training to the first ambush with the mouse, but then there are another 20 ambushes that look the same over and over. And the cast is really really miscast, from chamelet as the guy to chris walken as the emperor. Cant take any of them seriously.Now, I can’t remember the story or actually care about it because the first one came up years ago, no idea. But…",2

10295,"First viewing in full IMAX, good lord lol",4
4557,"Decent watch. Looks perfect and sounds amazing. The pacing feels slightly off, the fight sequences could be more elaborate and brutal for the weight of consequences they carry, acting is on point with the mesmerizing, awe-inspiring visuals. The movie battles with its white savior narrative which is why Zendaya's character is the best to watch. The white savior is ridiculed verbally and critiqued by the smarter Fremen for what it is, propoganda. Felt like it could've been balanced a bit…",2

10604,Got the full experience by not buying any refreshments prior to the viewing in imax,4

375,It’s laughable how Villeneuve expects you to be slack-jawed by just making everything big and obnoxiously loud but in fact it’s just embarrassing and tedious.,0

4250,Peaked in the first half ngl,2
3315,Somewhat silly (baby chatting made me laugh),2
6785,"This movie is kinda sick. I liked part one but it didn’t stick with me that much. David Lynch’s Dune is definitely worse but I remember thinking it did a few scenes in more interesting ways than Villaneuve and it left me feeling like it could have gone further in places. This one improves on the first one vastly and it’s definitely better, but most of that can be credited to the last 40 minutes or so.",3

1031,"I saw this movie on the big screen like you're supposed to, and it was sort of staggering to see such badly composed images blown up on such a scale, for so many minutes. It felt like half the movie was just tight close-ups of people's glowering faces in dim lighting. It's generic to the point of being offensive; the dialogue accompanying Paul and Chani's first kiss invites us to marvel at Arrakis, but the images have no compositional flair,…",1

5145,"Sandworms become Uber XXXL in desert. The narrative felt a bit archaic, its giving white savior exploiting the middle east to fulfill his own Hamlet revenge journey…Timothée Chalamet’s performance was mediocre, doesn’t really showcase how his experience has transformed him - he still looks and acts like the same teenage boy he was when the series started. Austin Butler is crushing Chalamet with his ripped body, sadistic attitude and high fashion model flair. And COME ON !!! centuries of women’s…",2

1544,I love Zendaya but girl had the same expression the entire film,1
2857,I found the first half engrossing and the payoff of getting to know Chani's character better was great. Worm riding was done well and I could appreciate Paul's struggle with the sense of control over his own destiny.

7121,"I had a good old time with this. On an objective level, it's definitely flawed. Some of the key moments and turning points are rushed through; the climax of the last act sticks very closely to the book in a way that doesn't work as well for an action film. And I suppose the look of it is mostly very typical of the brutalist Villeneuve style, maybe not fully exploring the crazy visual potential latent in the source material. ",3
2211,The way this slowly weaves the Bene Gesserit thread offered a glimmer of the dreamy understatedness and borderline arthousiness that made up the majority of the first film. Unfortunately this is otherwise a compilation of the worst of part 1 - primarily the very conventionality of its last acts and most of the action. Although here the closing moments are excellent but the film is choked by some very typical action and simplistic character building and dialogue up to that…,1

8315,Improved the pacing. Chalamet’s best performance. Benefits from the a part one doing a lot of heavy lifting in world building and initial character introductions. Although would benefit from spending more time on Feyd Rautha and building him as a menacing villain as well as relying on part 3 to hold up and continue the story.,3

2879,"I LOVED the first movie.In the second there was also beautiful music and visuals. I loved each fight sequence. But, unfortunately for this one, the media and everyone else overhyped it. I went in expecting more than I got. The first half was too slow for me. For the first 1 1/2 hours I kept waiting for something more important to happen.",2

832,"I know I'm in the minority when I say this, but I thought Dune Part 1 was already pretty slow & boring...but somehow Part 2 managed to be even more boring and monotonous. It felt both rushed & hollow, while also dragging on for 3 hours. Basically, it felt like a whole lotta nothing happed for over 2 hours with ambiguous time jumps, then the last 30ish minutes actually go somewhere, then it ends. I probably won't even bother with ""Part 3"" when/if it eventually happens.",1

The immersive experience that is Dune Part 2 can really only be described as just that, an experience. It truly transcends film and becomes something else entirely.

Had a brief summary of the plot of the first but was also pointed towards the quite obvious analogy with the war in the middle east - which is frustratingly on the nose at points. Also far too slow at the start, and then becomes clearly too heavily edited and rushed at the end. Some of the CGI and sound design (e.g. Foley work) is really good though.",2

2017,"My interest in ‘Dune Part 2’ drained away faster than a pump extracting the moisture from a Harkonnen corpse. I’ve not read Herbert’s novels, but based on this adaptation, the material does not lend itself to filmic storytelling; the script mistakes po-faced exposition for dramatic world-building.",1
3132,Being in the theater really shows how you need a high end array of speaker to hear what people are saying. Terrible sound mixing of movies nowadays. ,2
1044,Honestly this movie probably would’ve been a lot better if I knew what was going on at all. I thought I was having an existential crisis trying to get through it in the theatre.

8130,"Good, like the first, but this one feels over-stuffed. Which the first didn't. There's a lot missing. And I know Denis said there would be no director's cut, but that would be a huge injustice to his fans, fans of this series of movies, and fans of the original novels. ",3

7146,"Technically masterful and brilliantly directed, Dune Part Two is another stunning achievement from Denis Villeneuve. I'm not sure if I personally vibe with the direction that they took the story. It also feels too long for the amount of book they had left to adapt.

I think I can tell that I prefer the first film though but I'm open to that changing in the future.",3
1852,"In some ways better than the first (there’s more going on), in other ways not (the widescreen world building and Hans Zimmer novelty has worn off).

3152,"This movie has an odd rhythm, in terms of screenplay and editing. A giant portion of the story is squeezed in a short period of time (even though it is almost 3h long). Besides that, it's impossible to believe in the leading as a couple. At the end, I was having fun kkkkkk",2

5887,So funny. He said ah you’re shooting them with our big missiles. Genius move.,3

1404,"Mid. Way too much pandering to the modern ideology. ""Strong independent woman"" Zendaya and ""you are muh queen"" main guy being a tad bit too simpy made the last scene very cringe when it should have been powerful. Also the main guy is a marty stu, the villains are 1D and who cares about any of these characters anyway. No strong characterisations or depth to them. Plot was weak and predictable.",1

I’m willing to watch it again to swallow in all the shots. Still so many to digest but I think this was better than the first movie. Pacing, length, growth, all solid. Also shoutout to Austin Butler for making my day, I laughed every time he appeared on screen, he’s so cute.",3

7140,I was raised on Hollywood blockbusters. Most of them were trash but the ones that rose above in terms of scope and vision always resonated with me. There’s been a drought of real spectacle. I loved remembering what that felt like while watching this. The last shot is the same last shot as the Godfather,3

3661,"Viewers of these movies fall into two camps: huge fans and people that were bored by the length of this two-part book adaptation. I'm right in the middle. I liked the book, I even liked some of the more self-indulgent scenes in this movie, but I also agree with critics that say this book didn't need to be two 150 movies. I think I could cut enough extraneous material from the two movies as released to make one solid 2 hour film.",2
4810,i wish i cared more about the plot. there are things that i rly like and things that i dont. don’t like the appropriation of the Islamic faith and aesthetic or the white boy savior. like the way the women were written for the most part. hate timothee.

The entire ensemble only increased one another’s ability to evoke emotion: there was no weak-link whatsoever.

We knew the cast was gonna give (and did), we knew Mr. Denis Villeneuve and Mr. Greg Frasier we’re gonna give (AND DIDDDD), but CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE SOUNDDDDDDDDD.

I cannot worship Villenueve's work here only cause this is designed and shot a million times better than most movies today, but it is. And he makes the best out of Bardem, who I had never enjoyed till now. But Villenueve's still that who directed the dull selfserious Enemy from such extraordinary fun material in The Double.

3022,Dune 2 looked cool but I continue to not give a single fuck about any of the hallow characters in this franchise. Nothing really holds weight and I never feel too surprised while watching. It is in fact better than the first one. Sadly the next dune film I will be watching for free at my home.,2
957,I walked out of this with the same feeling of disappointment I did from Deadpool 2. ,1
3557,“I oughta drown you in that tub!” Greig Fraser’s cinematography continues to prove that he’s in contention amongst the all-time greats — every frame is a sight to behold.,2
3800,I have not read the book but I think these movies are probably doing a very good job at telling a complex story and make it easy to understand. However much like the first movie this one continues to rush through key story beats. The main battle at the end feels like it gets less screen time than the montage of them destroying spice harvesters. ,2
8143,I could tell this was an amazing movie. Sadly I didnt enjoy it as much because I had to be such a massive nerd and read the books after watching the first movie. Still had a great time watching the absolute SLAP against the empire by a teenager on the big screen. LISAN AL-GAIB!!!,3
6160,"This was a super cool movie, totally didn't realize there was a third movie coming, so i spent the entire movie being like ""wow how are they gonna tie this up?"" Lo and behold, they didn't. I am pumped for the third movie but worried it won't live up to the hype",3

3990,"Gorgeous to look at, glad I saw it in theaters. The atmosphere, the music, costumes, phenomenal. But the editing, pacing, and scripting often leave gaps that are too large. Paul's shifts in motive or perspective aren't given quite enough time to make sense. And there are places where the plot just moves at a speed that feels odd. It's a shame, because there are so many good changes in adaptation compared to the source material, and the ultimate tragedy of…",2

Soundtrack insane, the scale of this is infinite, the action is amazing, genuinely a once in a lifetime movie experience. I wish they let Josh Brolin play that baliset and sing more!!!",4

It’s hindered again by slow pacing, a long playtime, and divergent focuses on too many plotlines and characters.

2348,Villeneuve's holy small screen illusion! It's a religious exploitation film with a lot of big words! It can't offer 50 percent cinema of Dumont's mad space opera Empire and Lynch's cult adaptation! A mediocre studio action yammering! (4.5/10)My video review: m.youtube.com/watch?v=meLEB-PIhzU,1

5224,I was pretty gripped throughout this film. The cgi to me felt real which was great because there is nothing worse than watching a film and just noticing all the cgi. The colour changing scenes worked for me! Overall I thought aesthetically it was beautiful.  I think that the acting was ok in it - Timmy’s change in character was the most interesting part for me.

3285,"I had to sleep on this one because a 3-star rating is not at all where I expected to land. But...I found myself curiously unmoved by the first hour or so. Then again, a lot of what I enjoy about the world of ""Dune"" is missing from this second installment: the regality and code of honor that define Duke Leto and House Atreides, and how their lush homeworld of Caladan contrasts with the harsh landscape of Arrakis; the Shakespearean tragedy…",2

Chalamet in the first half and Pugh aren’t convincing enough to me. On the other hand, Austin Butler fully commits to his role and felt natural. I think my biggest concern is that you can’t feel Villeneuve’s identity in it - which also goes for the previous installment.",2

468,"I call Denis villeneuve style of filmmaking ""urgent-core"". He's not the first to do it, but here are some hallmarks, thematically grand scale with massive even global consequences, didactic frequently humorless tone and direction that clashes with the said production's unabashadely blockbuster sheen and sensibilities. Cap it off with IGN/GQ certified source media and you have the near perfect cinematic masterwork for politically inert white nerds who are oh so very tired of Marvel to yap away over nothing for…",0
3350,Worms were cool and I appreciated the excellent cape work from Timothee.,2
6725,"Yeah, I have mommy issues (I want to become the new Messiah for desert people)",3

5210,"In 167 minutes, there was no time for these brown people to be more than NPCs, huh? What accent was Bardem doing anyways?!",2
5362,shoutout to that mouse for being the best character,3
2772,a man was snorting the entire way through this. in other words austin butler was creepy deeky,2
9858,"Dune Part Two is a masterclass of a film with peak cinematography and amazing acting, the story of Dune is an AMAZING experience with ups and downs and a overall journey of a film which EXTENDS into the 6 part book series made in the 60s and 70s. I am Lisan Al Gaib",4
4814,This Movie was better than the first. Had some random unneeded things in the story but a lot better than last time. Explained the questions I had form the first movie. Felt like a new movie started half way through for some reason. Need to watch both Dune’s for them to be good. Would watch the Dune series again for a better understanding of the story.,2

9925,FILM OF THE YEAR,4
5051,"Weird (a compliment) but unwieldy. The glimpses of the future we got in Part I were more intriguing, to me, than the answers we get in this installment, but I did appreciate how the story both leans into its Hero's Arc mythology and calls bullshit on it. (I am team bullshit, I think, which is maybe why I ultimately prefer the unresolved ambiguity of Part I.)",2
3072,watched 45min of this at work yesterday didn't understand it butdoes make me wanna watch it for real,2
7113,such a great movie theater experience like that is something i will never forget... could not look away for the full 2 and a half hours lol. the cinematography is insane and as a dune series stan i felt enchanted to see the world of it come alive on the screen ,3

785,This movie is like a really pretty stupid person. It’s great until it it opens its incompetent mouth.,1
10032,"besides this being the most visually impressive movie of all time… i’m in awe of every single aspect of this film- the cinematography doesn’t need to be mentioned at this point, all of the performances are fantastic, but the story and world building are literally one of a kind it blows my mind that this film was even made. i’m in awe what the fuck!!!!!!!",4

7613,"Okay, so, overall, I enjoyed this movie waaaaaay more than the first one. I was more engaged throughout the whole movie, but just as confused as the first one. Paul is a messed up, power hungry, selfish man. Chani is loving, selfless, strong, independent woman, who stands her ground. Love Chani. Paul is weak; not a fan. Although I was hoping that Paul and Chani would make up by the end of the movie. I am stressed for Chani on…",3

9143,"okay i get you imax people i get you now ! this is also. my very first time seeing ANYTHING in imax. and compared to the regular screening, dune 2 infinitely Bigger and better in imax. and traveled almost two hrs for this MANNNNN should have done this w oppenheimer 🥹",4
2472,"It was fine, entertaining & much better than part 1. Kind of hard to watch in a joyous way as Palestine is under genocidal occupation.",2

841,chani watch out princess irulan HATES you,1
2065,"It was alright, I think the casting that I was iffy about upon first hearing about it worked out fine enough. The standout to this Feyd-Rautha, he was super cool and I loved the fashion behind him and the Harkonnen, it was like a surprise Rick Owens exhibit. Very very cringeworthy acting in this though it was rough from so many people and once again I can tell the directing is both excessive and dishonest at times. Terrible shot to…",1

2770,watched this with my boyfriend in seats that fart and that basically sums it up,2
959,what’s the point of setting up a fake roadblock to immediately ignore the roadblock? Suffers from book adaption disease imo… but it was pretty and the sounds were on point… thank god chalamet can come in as a white saviour to protect the brown people from an even whiter threat,1

7599,Epic visual effects + I loved BDSM Austin Butler. Tbh I kinda prefered the ending in Lynch’s Dune 🙊,3
648,"Dry. The casting lacks in places as a continuation from the ""book one"" iteration. Christopher walken, really? ""Foo FIGHTERS""! Anyway, the visuals of cgi crowds and buildings always take me out of the fantasy. While directed well with generally beautiful cinematography and costumes it still fell flat. There really is only so much you can do with source material that dense without plowing through but was still a slog to watch.",1

3221,"Feel very similar about this one to the last. Incredible costume and set design, some pretty good performances - sound design and cinematography made for the big screen. An impressive spectacle serving... what? The movie feels hollow - all of the major plot beats and set pieces have no real tension to hold them together or land them with any impact. The difficulties of adapting such dense source material show, leaving little time for any real *development* on the part…",2

4036,"Idk I just can’t get over the sudden character shift that happened for seemingly no good reason. Visually stunning, awesome choreography, and good performances from Austin butler and Paul’s mom in particular — a fun watch despite the rushed pace and frankly very silly dialogue",2
1,A mix between mad max and starwars but more shity,0
6063,"Lives up to all the hype. Honestly, Dune is everything that the Avatar franchise could/should have been. This film doesn’t fall into the science fiction/dystopian trope and just focuses on creating a moving, exciting story.",3

Shares all the issues I have with the first and then some. Beige as fuck. Thinly drawn characters. I can see a lot of money has been spent but not well. Big, empty spaces whether outside or in that lack grandeur and detail. Acting that confuses glowering for conveying a prickly emotional reality and complexity. Timothee is…",1
9521,Best Sci-fi movie of the last decade,4

10175,What can you even say. A special film from start to finish.,4
7594,"Great but doesn’t quite reach the heights of part one. Starting with the positives, it is an epic tale and really feels that way. The acting was very good with only a couple minor exceptions. Rebecca Ferguson was perfect for the role. Cinematography and actual compositions were incredible. The final fight scene is great and watching Paul’s transformation and eventual choice is great. The scene where he takes over the Fremen induces chills.",3

That being said, it’s still incredibly visceral and exciting and I’m obsessed with Feyd Rautha’s cannibal girlfriends. Rebecca Ferguson should win a GLAAD award for this.",3

11272,"The first time I saw Dune: Part Two, I thought it was a great movie. Watching this a second time helped me realize just how great this movie is: five stars. There are some differences from the book, but Denis Villeneuve kept the spirt and broad outline of the book very well.",4

The cinematography and sound design are beyond impressive and the casting was perfect. I definitely peed my pants a little when I saw Anya. The costume design was sick as fuck too.",3

5483,"The joy of going to the cinema has been destroyed by marvel movies. Without reading the novel I am not sure I would have completely understood the movie, although without reading the novel I would have been more blissfully unaware of the sections not shown in the movie. Watching the movie was a great experience, the sets and scenes are exactly what I imagined in my head while reading the novel and it was a great joy to see it come to life.",3
7893,"Watching this, this time and without seeing the first the day before the characters motives at times felt thin and plot not given enough context to follow. However this visuals are still beautiful, performance still sound (especially Zendaya and Austin Butler who gave the movie heart and chaotic energy respectively), and the ending GOES SO HARD: An emotionally charged duel, meaning silence, and longing stares hit ⭐️",3
1038,"Admittedly I hated Dune pt 1, but I decided to give Part 2 a chance on many recommendations. I wish I could say I loved it... but no. It's BETTER than Pt 1, but it's still a boring slog in many parts. Visually amazing and nowhere near as deafening as the first, but still a hot mess of a story that at 2.5+ hours, still feels incredibly rushed.",1

9275,if you don’t like this movie you are simply incorrect,4
7258,girl i watched this in an Imax cinema and i could actually feel the fight scenes i loved it,3
2312,Having not read the source material it's hard to put too much blame on writers Villeneuve and Spaiths for the constant plot conveniences throughout Dune: Part 2. Why do the Fremen allow Jessica to become their new Reverend Mother? Why does Paul drink the Water of Life? ,1

10725,"Lead me to paradise, space white Jesus.",4
11306,can NOT stop thinking about riding that worm,4
2614,"Just found the most overrated film of all time. I mean yes, Part One was too much expository and incredibly slow-paced, but at least it was consistent. This film, on the other hand, is an uneven mix of tones and suffers from some serious faltering quality, alternating between rare moments which are borderline impressive and entire sequences that truly showcase nothing short of awful writing. Paul and Chani's relationship is horrendously written, the whole cast is either underused or lukewarm…",2
1167,"I thought this was boring and indulgent. But I know a lot of people liked it, so I think it’s just not for me. I like things that lean more toward fantasy than sci-fi, and I have a really hard time connecting with anything set in a desert. I didn’t really understand Paul’s character arc, but to be honest I nodded off a few times.",1

4540,"Ngl I felt nothing, the commentary fell flat on its face because there was no weight behind any of the actions.",2
5054,Honestly probably a masterpiece if you enjoy sci-fi films. They really outdid it with the sound effects and music in general. Personally i think that they could have made it an hour shorter and the plot would still be there. I also couldn‘t get the words of my history teacher out of my head. He saw the film previously and was of the opinion that it was heavily inspired off of the nazi regime. Now after i‘ve seen it i definitely see which scenes he meant.,2
1361,"Extremely long winded to accomplish very little. Going in having no idea this wasn't the final installment, I was left pissed off half way through realizing this was another 2 hour plus movie that doesn't actually finish anything. The only highlight for me was Austin Butler. His performance was stellar. I'd watch an entire movie focused on just his character.",1

I was completely drawn in and absorbed, Villeneuve is so good at displaying the unique aesthetics that are present in Dune.

My initial reaction is that it is *severely* lacking, since it ignores the Guild entirely and gives short shrift to the other schools, the Mentats and Bene Gesserit. It diverts from real shit in the book to add a new Fremen female…",1
7297,Tbh Zendaya if my partner said “I will love you until my last breath” and then immediately afterwards ask to marry the enemy’s daughter I’d run away and try to ride a massive grandfather worm in a fit of suicidal rage too.

Chani is the perfect character because she is the only one who questions these “messiah” claims even though she loves Paul.  Austin Butler’s character is also pretty haunting and interesting, but it’s so funny to hear him still in character from Elvis lmaooo.  Amazing movie, highly recommend and can’t wait for the next movie (hopefully not the last).",4

First thing that blew me away, was the effects. So real and well done. I thought feyd was great and I didn’t know that Florence Pugh had such a small role in the movie. It was definitely much more of a slow burn then the first which can be seen as a disadvantage by some but I liked it. I’m sure when I watch it again I will have more perspective.",4

10898,"The sheer spectacle, mass, and scale Denis Villeneuve is able to capture is absolutely astonishing. So many shots in this film are breathtaking.

Zendaya is phenomenal in a cast this stacked, as is Austin Butler who I believe are the MVP's of this modern masterpiece. Phenomenal story-telling, Denis Villeuneve has and always will be one of best filmmakers of this century!",3

10269,I don’t know if I’ve ever enjoyed seeing a movie a second time in theaters as much as this. Somehow it was even better than the first time and I never found myself looking forward to a specific scene because every scene was amazing in itself. Making a movie that is just under 3 hours that has no filler is unbelievable and I will be thinking about this movie for the next week just like I was the first time around.,4

6748,Denis Villeneuve is such a wonderful director. I've loved his work since Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival. I have yet to see the rest of his previous work but they're on my watchlist. Sometimes I don't like remakes because usually the original is always better but I can see why he chose Dune. It can be difficult to capture the essence of epic stories and condense it into one 2 hour and 17 minute film. Imagine if Star Wars or…,3
7438,completely forgot the whole movie after leaving the cinema .. (4 stars bc the scenes with léa seydoux and austin butler made it for me and will haunt me in my dreams 😮‍💨🫢),3
2856,They had me in the first half then they lost me. Was definitely very cool seeing it in IMAX and was really vibing with the first part but then it just went on for way too long and was getting confusing and all over the place for me.

9025,i hope in every universe florence pugh and timmy end up together but i love the love triangle. also stilgar would love Fantasy Dune.,4
4921,Upon second viewing: Austin Butler's performance is truly standout. Incredible. A key failure of the film is that it doesn't quite develop him as a foil to paul + make their final battle more personal. I still feel Paul's transition is too abrupt. Dialogue is poor throughout. Bardem a positive standout. Zendaya's acting in particular is quite poor. Mixed bag but still a spectacle.,2
312,- Horrible script. A lot of the character motivations don’t make sense (get dropped and brought back in whenever the plot needs them to). there’s a part in which Paul finds out he’s related to another character and he plays it like it like it’s a surprise. Except them being related has no bearing on the film. The other character even gets killed off before the final battle in a very anti-climactic way. ,0
1916,"Really underwhelming. It succeeds with good pictures, great production, good camera and cut. It really fails in narration (what is going on, what are the motivations, why do people change their behaviour so suddenly?) and especially and to my biggest disappointment world building: where do the desert people have all the different textiles from? What do they eat? How do the desert mice survive? How can it be that people live south in the uninhabitable zone? Why don’t they use…",1

1743,"... eh? i honestly really wanted to love it i PROMISE im not trying to be a contrarian but like. the best and worst thing about these movies is that villeneuve is only interested in the spectacle, which means that while the spectacle is great (although giant worms smashing through sand gets less entertaining after the fourth or fifth time) everything else falls flat for me and i wound up wishing he had an interest in the themes and mythology…",1

4877,"I needed a lot more Harkonnen weirdness and a lot less Atreides montage. And better writing, for the love of god. Pretty cold, clinical filmmaking if you ask me. I want to be perplexed by something, anything. Makes me miss the filmmaker of Enemy and Prisoners. ",2
9473,"OMFG. He revived the cinema, revived the sound, the color, the magic, I was reborn again and again. Zimmer please, live forever, after having seen this magnificent movie I wonder if I have ever heard anything in reality. The photography, the visual effects, the use of black and white, the REAL acting. The best experience I have ever had in a cinema, every five minutes squeezing my hand, covering my mouth, smiling and breathing deeply to assimilate how overwhelmed I felt in a good way, something I had never felt, that's what the cinema gives me and why I love it with my soul.",4

I didn’t feel invested at all in the story or the characters and therefore when anything happened; including twists, they did absolutely nothing to me.

7619,Love it or hate it it’s arguably the first fantasy movie since the LOTR trilogy or early Harry Potter to create a set of images that feel iconic. Like listening to Mozart’s Requiem or the Life of Pablo there are exists such a sense of scale you can’t help but find intoxicating. Not entirely sold on whether or not it’s a great film but I was enraptured and Austin Butler was freaked up,3

3880,Impressed how a film with Timothee Chalamet and Florence was boring to me.,2
1229,"So sad to see Christopher Walken wasted like this. But then again, his performance can be read as an allegory of the whole movie. Because basically people in ""Dune: Part Two"" just sit or walk around in costumes and talk. The fact that he has some green as a background color then leads to the fact that there is a bigger universe in the background, but it never gets explored further. As others have stated, the fifteen minutes on the…",1
2371,"Same as the first one. All visuals, little substance. Its overly pretentious nature insists upon itself as being a “cinephile” movie, so ofcourse said audience would love this.

One of the best crafted films Ive ever seen, the visuals are so memorable and the sound is reverberating (watch it in imax, its worth it).

4675,"The visual styling and imagination of spectacle construction are relatively poor. Compared with the first film, it is very poor, and compared with Villeneuve himself, it is particularly poor. A waste of genre movie screenplay that has made leaps and bounds",2
5748,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not once was my attention lost. I think the movie is still setting up the plot, while in a way always waiting for something big to happen that never comes. The stability of Paul ‘s life may reflect more that the audience knows there will be more movies in the series, where every turn is expected for him. The subplots are getting more outrageous, but may have a bigger meaning beyond me. I am both pleased and ready for part 3",3

The design of the world is cool, if you overlook weak parts such as the main characters name being Paul or world building that doesn’t make sense. Otherwise, predictable story about a white boy being dumb. I guess it was one of the first, but did this movie really have anything new to show today’s audiences?",0

Relentless sound and action left great scenes feeling meaningless and boring after a while. No pacing, just ON LOUD the whole time. How can this be the same director who brought us Arrival, where every scene was full of quiet emotion and intensity. I felt like I was holding my breath all through Arrival and couldn’t breathe at all during Dune Part 2. So much potential, but all lost in bombast.",2

10451,"At the time of writing this review I've already seen the movie twice. It's hard to talk about a perfect movie, one that captures everything I personally look for. I think the scene near the beginning of the evil guys who are looking for Paul, when they see the plunger placed and the sandworm coming, the shot of them silently gracefully floating upwards towards the top of the cliff. It's perfect. It encapsulates what sc-fi is right now so beautifully.…",4

5816,"My main issue with the first Dune was the lack of interest in the characters. Paul was a relatively passive protagonist, so seeing him finally take control of the story and push the plot forward in Part 2 was incredibly satisfying to watch. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen till the last act. So I still didn’t particularly care for two thirds of this film. But boy oh boy was that third act exciting. The way this leaves off makes me very excited for Part 3. I know I said that about this film in my first Dune review, but this time I mean it!!",3
2831,"not bad of a movie tbh. in all honesty, i think that seeing it in theaters gave this movie extra points than if i were to see it at home. the visuals made up for a lot of the plot that didn't make sense. the plot wasn't too difficult to follow along with but i can see why it would be, i had some questions too. the cast made it more easier to watch as well!!overall 6/10could rewatch..",2

3701,"After an impressive opening act, one that I’d consider one of the best adaptations of a famous book since the LOTR series, part two works at a breakneck pace in order to get to everything in the last 2/3 of the book within 3 hours.

I definitely felt more engaged with this part of the story, but still not nearly enough. I can’t help but feel these characters, their thoughts and motivations, are being lost to the scenery and the spectacle. It’s not exactly my personal cup of tea but I don’t regret seeing it either.

I know it’s not exactly apples to apples but Denis and the team behind Dune clearly put the same passion into these movies that Jackson and his team did with LotR.

1557,"The more I am reading about it, the more I am warming up to it. But without reading the book, it is a long film where it cuts between incredible action and a lot of very complicated backstory. But the backstory, as delicate as it is presented does not help you to feel with any of the characters, and presents a blank black and white script to the film. It is a hero's story that walks a fine line between two words and falls down between the cracks. I might need a rewatch of both parts to get a better feel for everything.",1

5522,"Seriously overhyped. Even though the film is visually stunning, the plot seems illogical and derivative. The comparisons between Austin Butler, Heath Ledger and Javier Bardem are ridiculous. In many interviews Denis Villanueve emphasises the influence of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (apparently this film had a huge influence on the books as well), and the influence can be felt throughout the film. Part One was much better.",3

Straying more from the book could have improved the film (e.g.: the end fight is quite underwhelming after you've seen half the world go up in a CGI explosion ten seconds earlier, but that pacing works well in the book, where you follow Paul more closely).The reason I'm not rating it higher is because there's nothing this movie does that's particularly different or interesting.

2349,"I suppose it’s time to deal with the proposition of prophecy vs story in Part 2. However, the film is just trying to rationalize all the questionable debates by showing Chalamet’s charming face and making Zendaya an anti-heroic/iconoclastic figure, which, in my opinion, is just another way to ensure that the director has conveyed his reflection (or perfunctorily adapted the original work) on those issues.",1

Although I didn’t fully understand it because I missed some parts of the first film because I fell asleep oopsie, I was captivated by Timmy's exceptional acting, as well as Austin Butler's impressive performance.

The one where Paul is screaming at his mother to stop telling people he’s a profit, and the one where he screams at the freemen to shut up because he is in fact a prophet… :/ and idk if it was a theater specific thing but the sheer volume of the movie gave me a headache 👍🏼 pretty sand though",1

I think the film lacks soul and character and failed in making me care about any of it. The story is very simple but was overcomplicated so much to the point where it's actually funny how seriously they take it. I think if it were more self aware and had down to earth characters I would've enjoyed it more. But I just felt alienated the whole way through and couldn't really connect with anything in it.

313,"After first appearing in a scene that channels the average Jared Leto performance, Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha gets to really explore his character during a scene of gladiatoral combat. The scene takes place on the Harkonnen's home planet of Giedi Prime, which is largely seen in stark monochrome. Partially, this expresses the Harkonnen world view. It's also because the sun just does that. The audience sees this several times in a passable entertaining transition. You aren't really supposed to read into…",0

All characters are consistent, guilty, real, full of emotions although strategic, selfish, even cruel (dark and sinister Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and Lady Jessica). Hope lies in Paul and Chani and their moral compass and goal towards a common good. Direction, photography, wardrobe are flawless. To see on IMAX. you can ear the sand winds.",4

I’m not sure I’ll ever be wanting to casually throw it on like Part 1 but man, what an achievement of confidence.

Dialogue is superb and characters hold true to the first movie in terms of motivation. Villanevue’s cinematography and visual style fits this film fantastically.

2846,"Sand, blue juice, large worms, AND hit video game Worms Armageddon",2
6001,silly movie,3
246,Don't tell us that a significant romantic relationship was meant to have been formed but show us no said progression of it.,0
7915,didn’t see the first one! got it for the most part! ,3
9588,Top 2 and it’s not 2,4
9148,"From the landscapes, to the music, to the story, to the touching and human aspect of that movie, everything is perfect.",4
6735,4 stars for Timothee Chalamet’s butt in his stillsuit,3
2151,"Reasons why these films don’t really work for me:1. I have spent 5+ hours in this universe, and have yet to be provided a reason to give a fuck.2. Painfully literal dialogue. Almost every line is overtly expository, explaining what has happened, what is happening, or what will happen.3. I couldn’t even take Timothee Chalamet seriously as a prophet (even a boyishly annoying one) now a messianic warlord…With that said this occasionally thrills as pure spectacle.…",1
5410,Much more coherent and human then the first one while still managing to keep the epic sci fi aesthetics.,3
7325,Would fight and die for some spice ngl. First film was a little better and I wished the fights scenes were drawn out a little longer. People just die too easily,3
3729,Loved the story and the idea but hated the execution. The pacing was a disaster and the music was overused. But still look forward to part 3.,2
4858,love it when he rides the worm.,2
1479,"I find it hard to believe this movie is getting such praise for not doing anything well. This part of the story is a lot of scenes of two people having conversations in dark rooms. Takes a lot from George Miller in the visuals, but unlike Millar none of the action, which there is not much, is exciting or presented well. ",1
4328,erm... im only giving this movie three stars cuz i watched part two without having seen the first one. visuals and acting were good tho! 😭,2
10511,I began reading the book before I saw this and I thought to myself “I cannot picture zendaya as chani”. But then the movie one’s a complete 180 with her character  and then zendaya made sense,4
5547,Very beautiful to look at. Worth watching on the IMAX. Surprisingly after 3 hours it still felt rushed. Could have been 3 films not 2!,3

7667,Amazing cinematography. Every single shot is  a different masterpiece. Omg soooo beautiful And then … there’s timothee chalamet… why ? Like seriously… why is he still here ?? … The rest of the casting was great,3
8703,Dune: Part Two is a spectacle and the best example of a filmmaker working at his peak. Denis Villeneuve has become a master technician and his movie are perfect from a technical degree. The cinematography is beautiful and perfectly encapsulates the scale of Arrakis. There are about 15 shots that would be the best shot in most movies. The costumes and set designs are so lived in and real. The VFX is so well-integrated that there is not a moment…,4
1960,"Genuinely enjoyed the first one more on a second viewing (so might improve this on a second viewing) but this one is somehow even more dense and lacking in emotional moments (there only really being one central relationship you care about/has any tension to it). The aesthetic is again incredible, but I also think it's not as well shot as the previous one. Outside of the bits on the harkonnen planet I thought it wasn't noticably beautiful - genuinely wondered…",1
9816,"Sixth time watching on IMAX, complete perfection still, hoping to make it 10",4
3728,The first half of the movie was pretty boring. Later it got better but still was expecting more from such a huge production.,2

368,Dune 2? Du.. dun.. dune 2 girls a once.. more like… yeah. I’m not going to watch these movies.,0
2965,"It's not that Timothy Chalamet is miscast so much as Villeneuve doesn't seem interested in showing him mine the emotional conflict inherent in the story's moral choice, or anything beyond a fetish for the aesthetic (which is undeniably sublime). You can see why he totally reworked the Chani character because her frown is doing so much heavy lifting just to give us someone relatable. ",2
3390,"intense, visuals and lots of explosionsZENDEYA RIDES THE BIGGER WORM",2
912,i really wish i liked this but i got so bored in the last hour. the reverend mother is weird af and i’d prefer if she somehow got written out,1
3478,Lot more fetus cam in this than I was expecting.,2
7560,Unbalanced. Na-baron character takes too much part in the scenario to the detriment of Paul story.,3
8810,"I have so many different ways I want to write this review, so I’m just gonna write all:",4
4090,"To be fair, only saw half of the movie before I had to leave. Didn't really care for the Zendaya and Chalamet love story. And Christopher Walken was a really weird casting choice.",2
8585,This is how you dune it.,4
975,"Can someone please tell me if there were times in the book that the tone was a little silly and unserious? The first film has a very serious tone, then you get a silly goofy tone in this one. So either they have separated the vibes of the movies, or they decided they needed some comic relief..... I mean at least they didn't add a jar jar binks in so maybe I should be happier. ",1
5474,Good movie but you cannot watch it one sitting.,3
4995,"I’m not buying this dune hype for this film other then the acting and the cinematic masterpiece it is, it is fundamentally flawed the amount of jumping around without context to anything is quite remarkable(coming from someone’s who’s read the book)throughly disappointed.",2
4497,"I dug this one too, but it still feels like a miniseries that hasn't concluded and thus is a little unfulfilling. I still hope Villeneuve is able to make more parts of this, but also that he gets to make some other stuff in the meantime. I hear the next book is kind of a low point and might be the end, but it'd be cool if some miracle happened and he was allowed to keep going with this into, like, 7 movies, just as an exercise in longform sci-fi storytelling. I'm down for it.",2
2199,"Many narrative liberties are taken with this one. However, they are executed intelligently and in total service to more fully realizing, yet again, an incredibly dense science fiction source material. I can't fault the film for that. ",1
9728,How was this even better the second time wtf,4
1831,Besides the beautiful  cinematography and cool visual effects… it was fucking boring.Extra point for the sand worms 🐛❤️,1
10798,I feel devastating it's no longer on teather.... 😓💔,4
2734,"I did enjoy this but something really just rubbed me the wrong way about it, I just felt it was so rushed, I understand they had to fit a lot in, but things just happened, I didn’t think there were any stakes AT ALL, Zendaya and Timothee have about as much chemistry as a sausage roll and a windmill… how did they get all those people on a sand sand worm when earlier on in the film we see this…",2
6541,Space Arabs vs space colonisers,3
4238,Pretty cool,2
3885,Stuff like this is what makes me think a live action Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind would be a good idea (against my better judgement).,2
9895,"My mind was literally just blown away because of how amazing this film was in terms of soundtrack, cinematography, visuals, the acting, everything. I loved every single second, minute, and hour of this movie. It was so peak from the very start to the very end.",4
293,Make a complete movie you assholes,0
2609,Three star is just for some of the visuals and sound effect. Timothy doesnt fit well for the hype.,2
1421,Austin wasn't supposed to go back in for seconds,1
3903,"These two movies of Villenueve but also the one of David Lynch from the 80's more than movies are sensorial experiences but maybe because of that i always had an hard time to connect and empathize to this kind of world and this story, at this point i'm only curious to see how all ends.",2
10651,"If I could, I’d give it six stars.",4

721,"You may die. You may see. You may feel nothing and go home more empty than you came after just under three hours of senseless murder at the end of which you still won‘t understand what for apart from revenge and manliness. You may also wonder if the movie tried to demask White Saviorism or just repeated it. I respect the craft involved and the praise for this movie but I can‘t understand it. Too much spice, not enough flavor.",1

6375,Okay I watched this in imax and as far as the actual production goes this went super hard. I haven’t seen the first part nor read the books and I know absolutely nothing about this story but I have to stay I felt that this was just disappointingly predictable. Like I get that it’s a textbook heroic tragedy and okay maybe the book just didn’t offer a lot of wiggle room from this predictable downfall? Maybe it’s an issue of…,3

4352,"Yeah, I don’t know man. It’s better than the first by a wide margin and the visuals alone left me spellbound at points but…. I just didn’t connect with any of the characters, nor did I feel particularly compelled by the lore. It’s clear that Herbert was an out and out visionary, and that his brainchild has been adapted lovingly here. But the jockeying for power and influence seems so small-mindedly terrestrial that it is hard to buy these advanced…",2
