1108,the movie theater made me pay $6.75 for a coke of cola. then bald austin butler kissed his uncle on the lips. twice. and made hard eye contact with me.,1
3061,what the hell is even that?,2

1873,Davidehrlich’s review captures my feelings on both Dune movies better than I feel I can.  ,1

9935,How come when Austin Butler kisses his uncle on the lips it’s cool and intimidating but when I do it I’m “ruining Christmas dinner”?,4
4296,“Tell them a messiah will come. They'll wait. For centuries.”,2
3941,I'd follow Timothée Chalamet,2
8264,Wowowow. This movie is visually STUNNING and is packed with a stellar cast. ,3
10837,It’s truly a shame that I can only give this movie 5 stars. Paul Atreides is the coldest mf ever portrayed on screen. I must consume more Dune content or else I genuinely think I might die,4
10052,nooo they killed freaky bob,4
2419,"Cool visuals and score but mediocre performances tbh, don’t hate me.",2
650,"It might be rated high now, but in like 2 years everyones gonna look back and see it's really mid",1
5088,i did not watch part one and i also fell asleep for some of this so i’ve officially seen a quarter of the dune franchise 😍 why r people obsessed with this,2
10860,Watching this as a normal person: 😱😁♥️😊🫣😳😋🙂,4

2366,Vaguely oedipal rambling accompanied by an overly gung ho orchestra. ,1
4928,Somebody show this to Neil Postman,2
1263,Lushly visualized sci-fi epic lacking a reciprocally crafted plot or coherent and compelling performance from its main character.,1
10402,Somehow better than the first watch…..LISAN AL GAIB!,4
6832,"Definition of a blockbuster epic. The cinematography and the polarity of colors between the Freman and the Harkonnen was stunning, particularly the coliseum scene regarding Feyd. I wanted more sandworm and there was plenty of it this time around including transportation via sandworm(!). Ready for Dune: Part Three and the holy war.",3
10570,"I came into this movie with the Dune Popcorn Bucket and A LOT of butter, but nothing could have prepared me for what I would witness. The only word that can describe it is exhilarating. Loved the part where Willy Wonka killed Elvis Presley and said “this is Dune: Part II” and duned all over the place. Cinema. What’s 4 more years until the next one 🥲 Can’t wait.",4
2254,really interesting commentary on the relationship between the bible and capitalism,1
6940,This perfume ad was longer than the first one,3

5048,This is a good film I think. Not sure I get the hype. I feel like you have to have a sense of ”wow epic” for it to hit hard. ,2
5995,Biblically accurate,3
6613,me when i dramatically ride my worm off into the sunset,3
8456,we must dune-pill the non-believers. we need to convince them one by one. we will start with the weak ones. the ones that fear us. we will make them all believe.,4
3182,"Like many sequels, it suffered from pacing issues. This movie had to develop characters in between 37 huge set pieces and sort of didn’t succeed but it’s fine because it was fun. Big worms! Space war",2
3420,A grand massive set up. It feels cinematic. It's beautiful.,2
5842,"Significantly better than the first. After all the hype of Dune it fell very short for me, but this did not. In the sense that it’s very long and that it’s very good. I really liked the action and the characters were way more interesting. The plot was way more engaging and it was better in almost every other way. To me it still dragged at certain times and was very long, but I still really liked this.",3
4788,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.,2
9554,"i could watch another 3+ of this. felt so religious and intimate with love and horror. i’m literally shaking i cannot believe i witnessed something so incredible in my lifetime. forever will cherish this movie experience. this is why we come to the movies, this is cinema.",4
3458,"Unfortunately this franchise doesn’t really seem to be my personal cup of tea. Ask me what I remember from the first Dune movie and I’ll tell you it was really loud and there was big sand worms. A year from now, I will probably say exactly the same thing about this one. ",2
3043,"More engrossing in IMAX but still a mess of a film. I want to re-watch Villeneuve’s Incendies bc this could’ve been that in space… if you’re leaning this hard into the Middle East allegory, and delving this much into religious doctrine, go all the way and say something pls. But… also loved watching this with Kate and seeing her 🫣 at the Harkonnens lol",2
7125,it was very interesting and nice action stuff wasn’t bored like i expected to be but florence and zendaya should switch characters,3
8170,"Katniss: ""What's your favourite colour?""Peeta: ""Orange.""Katniss: ""Like Effie's hair?""Peeta: ""No. Not that orange. More like a Denis Villeneuve kind of orange.""",3
711,gotta hand it to villenueve. rly bold choice to make a sequel to david lynch's dune rather than dune: part one. if only it was anywhere as good :(,1
1684,"Dune Part 2, wow I hate being negative but this could be one of the most overrated movies of the modern era. Going in I heard amazing reviews, amazing experiences and nothing but positive positive and positive. When I watched it, I found it to boring, dragging and just so un engaging. Nothing about this movie stood out, maybe the cinemotography that’s about it. Would I recommend this, NO! But I have a feeling im an oddball in this because…",1
3348,"Folks seemed to give Across the Spider-Verse guff for taking a long time to tread a whole lot of water until the third movie, but I think it’s way more egregiously apparent with this mid-quel. Also, the first of Denis’s Dune movies did a better job: 1) Having fun and 2) Using its sprawling cast/characters well. Part Two takes itself too seriously and wastes too much top tier talent (save for Timmy and Austin Butler, doing his best Lost Skarsgård-Meets-Still Kind of Elvis).",2
1558,Wacky. I feel asleep two times watching this movie. The bald people are horrible and did not make the movie any better. I had more to say but I forgot it since I didn’t do the review right after the movie. I would not watch this again. I would rather stub my toe in the dark on my way to use the bathroom.,1
3284,Who up playin wit they worm?,2
4117,Really cheap costume design. Didn’t need to cast Florence Pugh honestly. Wants to watch a second time,2
11041,"How many Lisan Al Gaib’s you’ve seen come and go? Seven Thousand? Eight Thousand? Nine Thousand? Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine? Every single word that came out of the Emperor’s mouth was nothing but horseshit, but he was right about one thing: I am that one Lisan Al Giab in ten thousand.     ",4
9661,I'm convinced that this is a generational movie in the vein of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings! It's so grand and beautiful!,4
1056,"Not for me. To be fair this entire genre has never been for me and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed part 1. This one though… Jesus. Every single line of dialogue felt like exposition and if someone said “the One” or “the prophecy” one more time I might have popped a vein. So much world building, so little heart. Plus for a Villeneuve film it looked so ordinary. On a positive note, I’m chuffed that so many people do like it. We need films that keep cinemas open. But from here on I’m out.",1
3991,bloody boring waste of time I don’t care how pretty it looks,2
5573,"I have to admit, I wasn’t really a big fan of part one, so I was kinda expecting to be not that impressed by this, but it was so much better than I thought it would be. Nearly 3 hours long, and it barely felt like 2. Just so fucking entertaining and well-made. Incredible action scenes and honestly worth a watch for the cinematic experience alone. ",3
5877,star docked because of tickedmeoff choretowatchsinceSNL,3
11189,Paid for the whole seat but I only needed the edge,4
4265,I didn’t like part 2 as much as part 1. I knew the religious crap was coming but that didn’t make me like it any better. ALSO purposely using the religious crap to manipulate people into doing what you want = extra yucky. Still gorgeously filmed. The creepy stuff was well-done and creepy as hell. But I didn’t love it.,2

3777,This movie made me feel retarted I did not know what was going on 😝,2
4372,Now. I loved seeing this in theaters. But the more I’ve talked about it the less I liked it as anything beyond spectacle. ,2
6248,"I really can't, or shouldn't, complain about this movie. It brings to life a story that's lived in my brain so long now that it's old enough to vote. Three scenes (the wormride, Geidi Prime, and the return of a character from the first one, instrument in tow) overwhelmed my senses entirely and brought me to the edge of tears in wonder.",3
3287,"Thoroughly entertained, but very confused. I went into it blindly with 0 knowledge of the first movie or the book and had no idea what was happening. Why was Timothee Chalamet Jesus? Why did Austin Butler passionately kiss his uncle twice?? someone explain pls 🙏",2

9551,prolly a lil too early but this might be the best movie of all time. the austin butler introduction scene is the best scene ever watching dune 1 and dune 2 back to back was insane. this in imax is also something i am very grateful to have experienced insanely pretty movie. going to be telling my kids about watching dune 2 in imax the sound was literally making my seat shake it was sick af. dune 2 makes dune…,4
9247,"like every other movie with timmy as the lead i went in WANTING to not like it but…… this movie rocked….. its everything i want in a movie it was exciting, beautiful, good costumes, i understood what was happening, the action looked like it was Happening. i even LIKED timmy he actual was acting…",4
10153,At least Butler didn't sound like Elvis again,4

7242,This was one beautiful looking film. Enjoyed it a bit better than the first part. Excited to see the next possible installment. 8/10 on IMDb,3
2496,"Super disappointing as an adaptation but a lot easier to swallow as a movie on the second time. To this day Denis is a master of tone & immersion & without a doubt in the top three working directors today. Fraser, however, is without peer. I would say it’s a step down in pacing, music & personal identity then the first one but a stunning spectacle none the less. I was really excited seeing how they handled a certain plot revelation & I thought…",2

1456,"This movie was of high production, so again, fantastic visuals and score. And when I say the score was fantastic, I mean it’s uplifting then shakes you down to your core. It was a bit long, where there’s a scene of two that could have been cut because there was no payout probably due to poor editing. I’m not sure how first run through they saw it and still decided to keep it when they never addressed it later on.…",1
6421,"Grand scale sci-fi with some of the most beautiful production design I’ve ever seen. A touch less cold than Dune part one, but still got that signature evenness that can make for a sleepy watch if you aren’t into it. Also occasionally distracted by some writing or performance choices that felt incongruous with the world, but not enough to sour the whole experience. Costumes and cinematography are like nothing I’ve ever seen! Going to need a whole movie on the Bene Gesserit by this same team.",3
10924,Movie of the year. Insane.,4

3627,"these kinds of movies don’t really resonate with me. sorry to all the dune lovers. but i can really appreciate the cinematography and the powerful performances from everyone here. i watched this to support timothee the best i can. wasn’t a bad movie by any means, just not my taste!",2
4952,"okay my review is very unfair so if you’re looking for a qualified opinion move elsewhere. I only saw this bc my boyfriend wanted to, and i hadn’t seen the first one <3. it was hard to follow, but i had absolutely no context to go on so i’m sure the average watcher was intrigued but i was very confused. didn’t realize the bald man was austin butler?? all the acting was really good, but the movies was really violent…",2
1527,"Honestly, I just don't think Dune is for me. Every time something is happening it's big and bombastic and visceral and loud, but there is so much of Dune where nothing is happening, and everyone's speaking in quasi-reverent tones about some very silly things.",1

508,"Better than Part 1 in that I did not fall asleep during the film.  Would benefit from having a good script, and if Timothee Calamet could act.  Be prepared for 3 hours of whispering and then suddenly screaming, or screaming and then suddenly whispering.  Zendaya and Florence Pugh both give fantastic performances, just wish everyone else was in the same movie as them.  Also, the 10 minutes of worm surfing looked like it would be fun.",0
6513,I just really need to know how they get off the train worms,3
6796,This movie was so good. And bald Austin Butler looks like my boyfriend.,3
7155,Still need that spice,3
9857,"I don’t know if I can say it’s better than the first. It’s more action packed, it still seems to end on a cliff hanger albeit maybe a better one. We definitely need like 20 plus hours of high quality tv/streaming storytelling to flesh out this world because there’s so much more I want to know. In my opinion we’re just comparing masterpieces so whatever.",4
8142,"First 45 mins is 2.5 stars. Last 2 hours are 5 stars. Timothee Chalamet is 1 star. Zendaya, Florence Pugh and Rebecca Ferguson are 5 stars. Javier Bardem is 5 stars. Austin Butler and Charlotte Rampling are 4 stars. Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista are 2 stars. Christopher Walken is 3 stars. Lea Seydoux is a whole galaxy. (On reflection Bautista is 1.5 star.) Visuals and sound are 5 stars. Story is 3 stars.",3

2497,I think some of ya’ll might have had a little to much worm juice.,2
913,Sadly disappointing. The narrative is obscure and the characters uninteresting. Good actors are confined by a poor script so that the action sequences are rendered insufficient. Overall an unsatisfying and somewhat boring viewing experience,1
1135,people used to act,1
5456,"Undeniably massive, I really appreciated the effortless way that Villeneuve effortlessly guided us through action set pieces thos time. The love story of a young love gained and lost also works for me (even if I found Zimmer's droning a lot more annoying this time around) I struggled less with the beginning. The fact that this is Fayed Rautha's Dune Part I, and Paul's arc from fighter to Messiah feels a lot clearer this time, even though I can't help…",3
1992,It’s ok. Bit long innit,1
10271,Third viewing today and man yessssss. This is why we go to the movies. This is why the IMAX experience is the best thing to ever been created for film and film history. Denis handles SCALE on wholeeee other lvl. THE OPENING. One of the best opening sequences I’ve seen in a long time. That alone triggers “the magic of the movies” 10/10 phenomenal work. In a IMAX theater is the only ONLY WAY to view this piece of epic high art,4
10901,"This now marks 4 times of me seeing this movie, and I’ve loved it more and more everytime I saw the film. I originally saw it in a normal theater, then went to go see it in IMAX 3 times after that.",4

822,Watching these films feels like reading the Bible.,1
7445,"Wow wow wow wow wow, this was a banger. In my opinion one of Timmy’s strongest roles. The cinematography is beautiful, some of those shots are pure art. Lots of tense moments that are captured so beautifully, I was geekin. I was very glad to hear the absence of the desert wailing girl sound in the score too, I feel like that bugged me way too much in the first one. It’s like instead of using that shit to capture…",3
8785,Dune: Part Two: Part Four,4
7266,Been stewing on this for a week after watching for the first time trying to organize some thoughts. ,3
6844,"It's a tremendous movie in so many ways, but I do feel like the movie's flaws - or if you're being more generous, its narrative shortcuts - are more obvious on a second watch.",3
8888,"Dune part two for me is perfect! plot wise its good! it definitely surpassed the first one, perfect casting and each characters are superb! can't wait for Dune Messiah! 🏜️⏳",4
8177,Anya Taylor-Joy was phenomenal,3
814,plus two stars for the rupert murdoch mud bath baby but minus three for the horrors i saw in elvis’ bald cap.,1
5512,"Refreshing to see Chala-mala-bing-bong enraged though, actually intimidating",3
4356,"Beautiful to look at , but it took too little NF to get to the point. Part one was better",2
6777,"Honestly, from a personal opinion I was tempted to rate a bit lower, but I feel like I truly cannot deny the work and thought put into creating this beautiful film. Great cast, great action, beautiful shots, and wonderful score. ",3
6599,Now we're talking. This is a vast improvement on the first and is a complete movie this time.,3
5187,He's not the messiah! He's a very naughty boy!,2
9880,What do I write,4
7649,"My friend was staring at me through the previews and when I asked him what was up, he went “I like looking at you” so that haunted me throughout the movie but otherwise it was great",3
3679,"Again - very ehh. Not sure how it had this much hype - makes the movie way worse, super underwhelming. Don’t think Chalamet or Zendaya are very good, especially zendaya. She just doesn’t fit the role at all and was so corny. Good sound track and cool settings but it just wasn’t great. Combo of a bad GOT and Star Wars - comes off as Marvel-type movie. Not a fan.",2
5577,did not watch dune 1 and i was stoned but it was very pretty and the cinematography and music and everything was good,3
3303,"Better than the first, a little long at times (I’m getting old I guess). Really liked Austin Butler and Josh Brolin. Cinematography is beautiful. Zimmer still at the top of his profession for music.",2

6438,Good cinematography and I lovedddddd when Paul name dropped dune. Also. U don’t need to watch the first one to see part two 🤐,3
6642,"I was afraid that the film would be too hyped up and my expectations would be too high, but it honestly pretty much exactly delivered what I expected and hoped it would - a grand epic with every frame looking picture-perfect. I also expected, however, that it wouldn't really capture me emotionally and that expectation was fulfilled as well. Despite it having some very intense moments, it's a franchise I don't think I'll ever shed a tear over or one…",3
6611,"Hands down the best movie of 2024 so far. This raised the bar to a whole new level in modern sci fi cinema that every other sci fi movie coming out this year is going to have to compete with. It is an extremely well crafted film that director Denis Villeneuve obviously was very passionate about. I did have some problems with the pacing but that was overall my only main problem with it. The acting, visuals, story, and sound design were superb and this will be very hard to beat has a top 10 movie of the year. Go see it.",3
4332,Yawn. Struggled with this new over long film. Little character development and under developed sub plots. Luckily it looked epic and the music was suitably dark and foreboding. But ultimately a boring sci fi.,2

4727,"Zendaya and Tom Holland are a match made in heaven for AAA star power with 0 juice. Hinging the entire emotional payoff for Paul’s heel turn on close ups of her soured lifeless face have confirmed for me that she very much DOES NOT have it. Practically spells out the point of the text with Nickelodeon tier reaction shots. If you’re gonna commit, do an Austin Butler. This felt particularly like visual splendour wiped of the weirdness and eccentricity that make Dune, Dune.",2

Villeneuve has cold, sparse style like a Bethesda game that does not really fit this world.

Despite the run time, the movie feels like it ignores the internality of its characters to rush through every plot point, but doesn't even…",2

4364,"Whole movie is a basically a shakily constructed series of random, loosely connected scenes. No one bothered to make sure it made sense. Racial dynamics are cringe. I think they were just banking on it being saved by how cool everything looks, which it kinda is. This movie is a masterclass in making something feel extremely rushed and jumbled together while also somehow making it feel very long and tedious. Also, it’s pretty demoralizing to check the time during the movie and realize that even though you’re two hours in, you still basically have an hour to go",2
6854,"Enjoyed this one more than the first: there was a lot more action and stuff happening and more interesting characters and character development from the first. Set up nicely for the part 3 with the ending. Again, it looked and sounded amazing.

There's simply no way to lift up this disaster. It throws away all the immensity and mystery of the first for ""characters"" that are merely jokes now. What does Villeneuve even do here?

8766,"It's so cool that the film explores one of its main themes, namely the inherent fallibility of man, through (what should theoretically be) infallible all-seeing characters (Paul & Jessica). You give man the powers of God, you could make them literally see and know everything, and they would still be capable of self-delusion. Is there a future for the Fremen where they liberate themselves without Paul, without a billions casualty jihad? I guess we can never know, and we have Paul…",4

Despite any merits in individual set pieces, there’s a lack of cohesiveness to the narrative that should bind them all together.

I really did appreciate the movie's thematic approach to religious fundamentalism, the power of myth and belief. I also found Paul's development very engaging and interesting. The movie is however far from perfect and cannot support the bloated runtime.",2

470,The great thing about the Lynch Dune is at least they were able to think of a design concept for the movie other than let’s just copy bits from Middle Eastern culture. This felt orientalist and boring. Too bad the makers of the movie couldn’t try to rub their braincells together to try and be creative for two seconds.

The glorious, mythological, bloodlusting Feuyd-Ratha gladiator scene photographed in gorgeous black and white touching upon the Japanese sexual aesthetics of death (which Villeneuve seems to be fairly interested in recalling the newborn replicant murder scene in 2049) almost made me forgive the shortcomings, but unfortunately not enough to allow it full grace.",1

Elvis getting done dirty by his barber to the point where he looks like a bald Pennywise.,2

Cinematography >> acting >> Hans Zimmer >> Austin Butler being evil >> Timmy Chal’s vocal range lol >>LoveThat being said, I think the one thing these movies have lacked thus far is enough emotional range in the characters for me to care about any of them. I was kind of getting there with Paul but then he drank the worm piss and got weird and i didn’t like how he betrayed our girl chani. Other than that, I mean, perfect. Also that’s kind of just a sci-fi trait. They tend to be more about the politics than the characters majority of the time.",3

It’s kind of like the CrossFit of movies, in that it is constantly telling you, throughout, how good of a movie it is. That being said, it’s a bit on slow side, and I feel like it basks in its own visual spectacle a little too much when it should be advancing the story forward. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great, well acted, visual feast with a meaty story… but it’s a little full of itself in a way the first one was not.",3

The way it's written, we don't follow many of the major battle scenes, and Paul's corruption arc is, to an extent, minimised. This lead to many readers misunderstanding the novel, believing the text to be an endorsement of the white saviour trope it is criticising. I…",3

2250,Never before have I seen an adaptation use all the correct signifiers for all the wrong purposes. There are unforgivable changes to the core story that rendered the conclusion of Villeneuve‘s two part adaptation of the first of Herbert’s Dune novels utterly devoid of pathos.,1

9810,actually one of the best movies i have seen,4
6848,I really didn't give a shit about the characters. The story and visuals are epic. But the movie feels devoid of emotions for me. I loved the movie but i didn't connect with it. But that's just me,3
4272,"This movie by no means was bad, but its wasn’t amazing as everyone says. Going into this I had pretty high expectations which were crushed by the end of viewing. Like Dune 1, the visuals and sound design were elite. The choreography was amazing and the writing and acting as well, but also like the first movie, I thought it was boring. boarder line painfully boring. That is with an exception of the last 30 mins or so. I can’t say it was bad, but I can’t say it was great. Good movie. Just… good.",2

9210,"Following the first film, the part two of this film really offer me a new level of cinema (one of the reason is because I watched it on IMAX screen). The story escalate so good, because after the introduction in part one, in this movie, we finally getting to know about the battle. A battle and a journey so epic I thank God I watched it on IMAX.

1478,"What about this film appeals to the humanity of a person? What connects your soul to this? Characters are expendable or completely change on a whim, and after spending 4+ hours with these people, I feel NOTHING when they abruptly transform. I am left seriously questioning Villiveneuve’s ability as a filmmaker and artist. Every frame is crafted to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible, seemingly without any thought put into them other than ‘make it look cool.’ This is clinical…",1
377,"I have now watched over five hours of Dune movies. I am still waiting for something to happen. These movies to me seem like they are only enjoyable if you’ve read the books. I was very confused and very very bored for 85% of the movie. Is it visually stunning? Yes. Is it a technically incredible movie that achieves near technical perfection? Yes. Everything about this movie is very good except for the most important thing, the plot.",0

3377,i feel like i probably should have seen part 1 before watching this because i was very confused. the cinematography however was *chef’s kiss*. only 3 stars because there wasn’t enough florence pugh.,2
5596,Definitely a fucking brilliant movie in terms of acting and just sheer visual. I'm giving it the same as I gave the first one. I think it's good but I will say I just didn't feel as connected to it as a lot of people seem to be. 8/10,3

4798,"I went into the first Dune (2021) with as high expectations as everyone else’s only to be let down. I attributed some of that to unrealistic expectations and gave it a second watch only to have my first impression validated. Therefore, I had much more modest expectations going into the sequel despite the online fervor of it being the greatest sci-if film of all time….which it is not. Dune: Part Two (2024) is a much better film than the first…",2
813,quite boring but still cool!,1
10478,The hype is justified this was insane,4
3144,"Finally got the Dune name drop, you love to see it. Pretty much what I expected from having read the book and seen the previous movie, stunning visuals all around and great action set pieces. The relationship and Paul’s rise to power felt a little rushed compared to the deliberate pace of some of the establishing shots and action sequences, but it didn’t detract too much from the experience. Would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the first one, and I have a feeling this will be a great trilogy to do watch parties of when it’s all said and done, like people do for LOTR",2

I can feel the constant, substanceless insistence on grandiosity and scale glaring out of the screen, harshing my senses, and I’m honestly offended at how slack-jawed this film expects me to be. Disrespectful. ",0

4050,"The film has great scenarios, a good quality sound when the battles begin, but it has a certain exaggerated sound in the moments they touch the sand. The movie story is very well created, however some scenes don't show the thorough context or the characters don't execute them in a more realistic way, which it went into bad made excerpts.",2

7197,"Honestly thought it was overrated at first, but grew on me over time. Story is thoroughly thought through and asks interesting questions applicable to real life. But to me it’s basically “what if anakin sky walker got away with it”. Maybe the best looking movie I’ve ever seen though and that deserves credit.",3
4796,SLOW THE FUCK DOWN,2
3613,Is it just me or did Timmy not do the sexy voice thing in this movie minus 2 stars,2
5319,Sadly I was taken out of the trance that is the scale of Dune and reminded that movies are supposed to have compelling plots and characters and motivations that go beyond vaguely summarizing source material. ,2

2589,It felt too long and rushed at the same time. Making the book a trilogy would've felt better.,2
3551,"Haven’t yet pinpointed when it lost me. Sometime in the first third. As far as I can tell, it’s as simple as condensing way way too much storytelling into a 3 hour film. Either streamline the book or give things more room to breathe. I can’t imagine non-book readers feeling engaged on a character level for most of this movie. ",2

2902,"A beautiful feast for the eyes and ears, but for me, sadly not a lot else. This deserves every visual and sound award it can pick up, but for me this tried too hard to be Sci-fi ‘Laurence of Arabia’, but without the emotive performances, or writing to back it up. I wasn’t captivated and by the later half, id even go so far as bored in certain places. The final battle was the highlight, but unfortunately couldn’t redeem the rest of the movie for me.",2
3725,Too much grunting and bald men,2
6508,Makes no concessions to anyone who hasn’t seen the first film and then proceeds to tell a story of political intrigue and religious zealotry. That it does this and is still engrossing and exhilarating is a remarkable achievement. ,3

2239,"I don’t think I’m fully immersed in this franchise to give an unbiased review, but there’s only so many times I can watch explosions in the desert and think it’s cool. 2 stars for the special effects and Zendaya",1
9307,"as per tradition, i made it to yet another installment of the dune series 30 minutes late, and it was still 5 stars. there is just something about the music vibrating through your body and the lighting of some of the scenes that felt so ethereal. i honestly liked this better than the first one. the twists at the end were also fun lol",4

7746,"A superb science fiction film. It's interesting to come out of that movie thinking it's a brand new and completely unique story, then only to reflect on how similar it is to the oldest stories I know.
